I don't actually know the reason, but I had a look at those links to try and find out what's going on and here are a few things that I spotted. To clarify, to get the 2% figure, did you multiply the GWP by the proportion of greenhouse gas of a given type (I did this and agree, by doing this it would seem like CO2 contributed at most 2% ), or have you found another source stating that?  I think we have to be careful about the assumptions we make when simply multiplying those numbers though because:  Firstly, are the relative percentages of gas given out by mass? They didn't label their data explicitly. I would have assumed so, but then again on second thoughts I would have expected the F-gas percentages to be a *lot* lower than CO2. [ok I have seen now you mention this in one of your comments above, and it looks like this is KEY. They need to label their chart better!].  Also, the GWP represents the amount of heat absorbed over a given time frame (relative to CO2), if a tonne of gas is added to the atmosphere now. That is a bit different from representing the amount of temperature increase that has been caused by gas the gas already in the atmosphere. In their link explaining GWP, it explains that GWP are different depending on what timeframe you look at. It can differ if you are measuring energy absorbed over say 20 or 100 years depending on the life time of the gas relative to CO2. It seems like this wouldn't make the CO2 contribution any larger though, since F-gases have long life times so the longer you measure, the worse it is relative to CO2 (CF4 is given as an example in the FAQs).  https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials But  in that link in the FAQ it also says GWP changes with differing concentrations of gas already in atmosphere. So GWP represents the effect of adding a bit of new gas - then it’s the energy absorbed per tonne of new gas - but it might not work the same for large amounts of gas, like the total already in the atmosphere. No idea how this would work, but for example I could imagine a scenario where the more of a gas you have the more it can interact with itself, and maybe this affects how much energy it can absorb (??). Or maybe CO2 has had a large effect in the past, but adding more and more makes less and less of a difference so the value for CO2 GWP goes down (or, as everything is normalised to this, everything else goes up)? (Just as an extreme, imagine you could get to a point where there is enough CO2 to absorb all radiation - adding more CO2 would make no difference at all, even if early on CO2 addition had a huge effect).   Finally, if you were wanting to look at the contribution the different gases in global warming in all the time since the industrial revolution, then you can't just multiply the total amounts of gases released by their GWP - not all those gases released have been around for the same time. My guess is that things like the fluorocarbons have been around only a lot more recently, so in the beginning CO2 was having by far the most effect and the things with high GWPs like fluorocarbons just haven't had time to increase global temperatures as much *yet*, even if in the future they will have a greater effect.   Another point about focussing on CO2 is that maybe that is just an easy target that something can be done about? I think because of their high GWP, lots of fluorocarbons are also already banned - yes they may still be hugely affecting global warming given their long lifetimes, but there's not much we can do about those already released (or maybe we could, who knows?). N2O also has to do with burning fossil fuels (such as in combustion engines), at least in part, so if you try to decrease fossil fuel use, you should decrease both CO2 and N2O. My guess is that its similar with the black carbon mentioned at the bottom, which is not part of the graph as it's not a gas. Also maybe we hear about CO2 so much because that is something individuals can do a bit about by decreasing energy consumption in our personal lives with transport, heating etc, whereas other things like methane or N2O could be affected more by agricultural policy or investment in cleaner technology but are difficult for individuals to change, so there might be less campaigns aimed at the general population about them.  Overall, my guess is that its more complicated than those graphs make it look, and CO2 probably accounts for more than 2% of human's effect on global warming, at least averaging over the past. But I would definitely be interested about how much of an effect CO2 has relative to other gases, since I agree, using the numbers in the links above doesn't make it look like it’s the most important one. I know there has been a bit of talk about methane for example, and wonder how important this is. You might be interested for example in these two articles about methane being released from rice paddies:  http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090818/full/news.2009.833.html http://www.wri.org/blog/2014/12/more-rice-less-methane  Thanks for pointing this out, it is very interesting, and I would also have done the same thing with those numbers, so this has reminded me to be careful! Hopefully at least some of this was useful to you too. I would also like sci-show to do an episode about this, also with more info about what can be done on a global scale to reduce the rate of global warming.",1,2017-11-18T14:53:56.000Z,0.10435628392799999,0.419926338212,en,nature_news,http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090818/full/news.2009.833.html,False,False

Also, you admit yourself that we're talking about CHRONIC users. Obviously it's common sense that any drug should be used in moderation. Smoke weed everyday for 10 years and you MIGHT have less grey matter according to one study. You imply that even occasional use is bad when these studies focus specifically on chronic users.   Drink alcohol everyday for 10 years and you'll most likely be dead.   Also, according to the study, the brain INCREASES nueroconnectivity to make up for the loss in grey matter anyway.  ""As described in PNAS, the researchers found that, compared with controls, marijuana smokers had less volume in a brain region called the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is involved in decision making, emotion and controlling reward- and punishment-related behavior. However, they also found that this region had more structural and functional connections with other brain regions, which they speculate could be an adaptive response to the reduction in OFC volume.  They also discovered that the earlier the participants started using marijuana, the greater the increase in brain connectivity in the OFC. Furthermore, the biggest increases in connectivity were found to appear as participants begun using marijuana. However, the re-wiring was found to decrease after 6 to 8 years of chronic use, although users still continue to display more connections than non-users.""  Also, saying it ""makes you dumb"" is misleading. The article literally says ""no correlations existed between IQ and OFC(grey matter) volume.""  This is what your comment SHOULD have said.  ""Studies suggest that marijuana may decrease brain matter after many years of use, making you have mood swings, loss of impulse control and other things related to grey matter, but the studies are inconclusive.""",0,2017-11-07T17:28:26.000Z,0.022569444444400004,0.408680555556,en,iflscience,http://www.iflscience.com/brain/chronic-pot-smoking-associated-brain-changes/,False,False

A common theme you see here is ""There is no PROOF."" And that's because it's almost impossible to prove an effect on such a scale without extensive experimentation.   BUT, an example of the topics talked about is: Gravitational Lensing, where light bends around stellar objects. We used to be extremely confused why mass-less light was affected by gravity, and now we utilize the space bending theory. If the very path it takes is bent, of course it will curve. No contradiction to the laws of physics now. This also applies to black holes. Light is affected by them and can't escape, because the distortion around them is so deep and strong that even the speed of light can't climb back out.   The example I gave is simple, but not exact for sure, because space isn't a flat surface. But it's effects are regularly noticeable to astronomers and physicists in their line of work.  This theory comes direct from Einstein,  whose general relativity theories HAVE been proven in observation in general.  On TIME curving, it displays that effect by slowing and speeding time up. This makes sense if you think about it and remember that the perception of time is a relative effect, also posited by Einstein and has been shown by our GPS satellite's clocks running at different speeds than the ones on earth. Someone travelling along a curved path in time takes the same amount of time for them, but to an observer they are travelling a longer distance.",0,2017-11-04T18:31:57.000Z,0.036038961039,0.454119055548,en,nasa,https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic,False,False

He discovered an extraordinary amount of contradictions and errors. For example, the late Sir Cyril Burt, to whom we owe much more information about twins raised separately, continued his research on intelligence for more than forty years. Although he has argued for the representativeness of his various versions, some of his coefficients change only from the fourth decimal point, which is statistically impossible. It was then proved that Cyril Burt had been researched and that his studies were just as imaginary, as much as the collaborators who would have participated in it, and that it had been invented from scratch (Research No. 113, July - August 1980) And the results that I presented to you earlier would be impossible anyway if that were the case. Besides, even if IQ was really 80% genetic,  The differences in points can always be entirely due to the environment, because we do not know the true number of points due to genetics or due to the environment, one could then very well assume that all populations have an average of IQ at 100% to 80% genetic and 20% environmental influence their IQ negatively or positively 25 points, which is about the same number of points of difference between whites and blacks for example! x') 100 pts -> 80%      (100x100)/80 = 125 pts     ?        -> 100%            125 - 100 = 25 pts  The bell curve is definitely not the ultimate reference, isn't? :')",4,2017-12-07T21:02:57.000Z,0.032819264069300004,0.561147186147,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/iq-boot-camp/201605/new-evidence-iq-can-be-increased-brain-training,False,False

Well... modern science has recently confirmed many of these beneficial health effects.  Garlic is closely related to onions and despite its strong aroma, it’s one of the most consumed foods around the world.  In antiquity, it was used to give flavor to dishes, stop pests, and even repel vampires and demons.  While this last one is pure superstition, there are many people who think that garlic can help combat negative energies.  Whatever the case, we know garlic is rich in essential nutrients, and possesses many important medicinal properties and a variety of benefits for your health.  Garlic provides a significant amount of calories, up to 100 per 100 grams. However, because you’re never consuming it in large quantities, it can not cause weight gain.  Garlic contains complex carbohydrates and proteins that improve physical and mental performance.......

Sperm are pretty amazing and well equipped for their mission, more like commandos than tadpoles. Part of their kit is a 'warhead' that allows the sperm to dissolve tissues.  ""An important structure, the ""acrosomal body,"" that will eventually develop highly erosive enzymes--able to dissolve the membranes around other cells--is made by Sertoli cells at the newly-developed head of the sperm and sealed in a protective coat.""  http://www.icr.org/article/4314  It doesn't take too much imagination to see how sperm can infiltrate cells, it was designed to do exactly that.  Another interesting thing about women's DNA is they use either one X or the the other in each cell, just like calico cats fur. Maybe they are utilizing both the X and the ""borrowed"" Y like males do?  Semen has physical effects on women too. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201101/attention-ladies-semen-is-antidepressant  And some women hate the idea: http://jezebel.com/5936639/semen-can-literally-control-the-female-brain",0,2017-09-19T20:24:49.000Z,0.129285714286,0.48448979591799995,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201101/attention-ladies-semen-is-antidepressant,True,True

Broccoli has long been considered a ""super food,"" but it is sulforaphane, a concentrated form of the phytochemicals found in broccoli sprouts, that’s shaping up to be the true disease fighter.  Studies looking at the supplement for treating and preventing cancer are very promising, said Duxin Sun, a pharmaceutical researcher at the University of Michigan. In one study, sulforaphane was able to reduce the size and number of breast cancer cells while also blocking tumor growth. “We have shown that it can stop the growth of cancer stem cells to inhibit the growth of onco genes, and may also induce the production of detox enzymes to prevent cancer,” Sun said in an interview with ABC News.  The  cancer-fighting power of broccoli has been proved on various occasions, ever since studies in the mid-1990s showed that the broccoli compound glucoraphanin, which is a precursor to sulforaphane, boosts cell enzymes that protect against molecular damage from cancer-causing chemicals....

97,wa95eicsNpI,David Cassin,https://yt3.ggpht.com/-2tc4kh1h77k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YiW8FfKr740/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfTh7225OkXb03p0RCOLPLw,"Responderei de acordo com os parágrafos (só para esclarecer).  1. Não estou confundindo Fernanda, como eu já te disse: tem feminista que nega, não estou discutindo aqui o posicionamento da Sabrina ou o teu, abordei apenas a questão que há feministas que falam isso, agora não sei dizer quantos são etc, só posso afirmar que tive contatos com ela.  2. Concordo plenamente que a minha experiência não tem validade alguma neste sentido, talvez eu devesse ter contextualizado melhor, mas o meu ponto do comentário é que há essas feministas (aqui não vou discutir se é maioria ou minora, isso é irrelevante) e que elas fazem parte do movimento feminista, por isso que comentei antes: Você e a Sabrina podem não estar em contradição, mas isso não quer dizer que não haja contradição no movimento (parte dele ou algumas pessoas que fazem parte dele).   (Esses dois tópicos para mim, desvirtuaram o debate, o que quero deixar claro é que você pode dizer que isso não é aspecto majoritário ou inerente ao feminismo, mas há pessoas contraditórias nele, para mim perdemos tempo discutindo detalhes irrelevantes nesses tópicos)  3. Neste sentido peço desculpas pela má-interpretação, se tivesse prestado mais atenção isso não teria ocorrido.  4. Agora percebi que não fui claro nesta parte. O que quis colocar é que o homem não tem autonomia para rejeitar o filho, se a primazia de ter o filho cabe a mulher então já é conceitualmente impossível o homem rejeitar o filho (existência), ele pode abandonar o filho, mas ele não tem o controle sobre quando e como ter o filho, e assim como você mesma afirmou quem tem a palavra final dentro das concepções feministas (majoritárias) é a mulher.  (Não entrarei no ponto se o homem deve ter essa autonomia, porque não me baseio neste ponto para ser contra o aborto, o que queria apontar é que a situação do aborto já coloca uma situação desigual na decisão de ter o filho).  5. 1- Realmente há muitos abortos inseguros que ocorrem, por isso eu defendo políticas públicas que tragam igualdade nessa relação com a proibição do aborto (falarei delas mais abaixo). 2- Neste sentido é por isso que defendo reformas na legislação, algo que vejo como injusto por exemplo é a questão da prisão na pensão alimentícia, pois especialmente se o sujeito é pobre é mais fácil ficar preso e não pagar a pensão do que cumprir com suas obrigações. Concordo que a situação é desigual, mas vejo alternativas que tragam igualdade nessa relação mesmo proibindo o aborto.   6. Desculpas novamente pela minha subjetividade, as vezes acabo me colocando numa situação de que a pessoa vai entender perfeitamente o que quero dizer.  Digo Igualdade no sentido de ter os mesmos direitos, é o ponto do parágrafo 4, a mulher neste sentido teria autonomia para não ter o filho, enquanto o homem não, criando uma situação desigual neste sentido. O meu ponto aqui é: há situações onde não há como permitir os mesmos direitos para ambos e novamente ressalto, não é que hoje não há desigualdade, mas para resumir: uma desigualdade não justifica a outra, eu entendo que a coisa mais igualitária seria a proibição para ambos, desde também ambos aceitem as consequências de forma igualitária também e não como ocorre esses tempos onde a mulher tem que dar conta de tudo.   7. Entendo perfeitamente que vocês defendem uma maior educação sexual para melhorar a igualdade reprodutiva entre ambos, e entendi que vocês não veem o aborto como um meio para um fim, sendo assim eu vejo que a defesa do aborto se torna mais irrelevante, porque troca uma desigualdade por outra (nesta relação específica, claro que isso pode diminuir a desigualdade em um modo geral, mas não neste caso, baseado no que disse no parágrafo 6/4.   8. Eu apenas falei da onde eu tirei, de qualquer forma outro ponto irrelevante para o debate central.   9.  http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2011abortion/2011wallchart.pdf Veja este link, verá países onde o aborto é permitido em todas as situações como o Kazakhstan onde a taxa de aborto é de 32.3 e outros países com a mesma legalização como o Nepal onde a taxa de aborto é de 5.3 (isso só para mostrar que não há correlação entre a liberalização do aborto e a sua diminuição). http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/factsheets/FS01AbortionintheUS.pdf Este dado mostra que a liberalização do aborto aumentou a quantidade dos abortos nos EUA, estabilizando posteriormente (não indica qual é a razão dessa estabilização, mas sugerem ser a retirada de instituições que faziam o aborto).  https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2016/abortion-rates-declined-significantly-developed-world-between-1990-and-2014 E por último este estudo indica que a taxa de aborto nos países desenvolvidos diminuiu, enquanto que nos países em desenvolvimento se manteve estável.  “Realizar mais investimentos em serviços de planejamento familiar de qualidade ajudaria a reduzir as taxas de gravidez indesejada e, portanto, as taxas gerais de aborto” (Deixo esta citação, por isso defendo melhor políticas públicas de qualidade em vez da liberalização do aborto).  10. 1- Não entendi essa parte, tentei entender mas não consegui. 2- Realmente não tentei fazer e isso porque depende de qual ética você compactua, se você fosse uma kantiana eu chamaria pelo imperativo categórico e mostraria que o aborto é errado (uma vez que ele não pode ser uma regra universalmente aceita), se você fosse uma utilitarista eu sequer teria argumentos, não adianta eu dar base ética e no final você não achar tal ética interessante.   11. Neste sentido creio que isso acaba colocando um ponto no meu 1/2 parágrafo, eu estava criticando este movimento e colocando vocês neste ponto. Neste sentido dois pontos: 1- Algumas das minhas críticas aos movimento feministas continuam válidas (se concentrando nessa vertente mais liberal e populista), elas só não enquadram no movimento mais consciente do feminismo. 2- Peço desculpas por enquadrar você e a Sabrina nesse grupo, e aqui eu dou uma dica que não sei se será relevante ou de alguma ajuda, dê uma identificação feminista para que a crítica não seja dispersa, acho que isso evitaria metade das irrelevâncias que discutimos aqui (desviando do ponto do aborto).  Conclusão:  1- Verdade e peço desculpas neste sentido, uma irracionalidade da minha parte neste quesito, tentarei consertar isto. 2- Concordo que aumentaria a igualdade num âmbito geral, mas para mim já há uma desigualdade intrínseca nisto, e não acho isto apropriado, para mim as desigualdades deveriam se diminuídas de outras forma como aumentando a responsabilidade do homem neste sentido.  3- Não há problemas, chega uma hora que realmente fica chato ficar respondendo comentários, entendo perfeitamente. 4- Só quero esclarecer que não vi ou entendi nenhum tipo de ofensa, eu só havia falado isto por precaução, mas felizmente você não é como a maioria do pessoal da internet que quando ouve uma discordância já se irrita, neste sentido achei o debate reconfortante.",0,2017-11-20T03:13:56.000Z,0.0125,0.763888888889,pt,guttmacher,https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2016/abortion-rates-declined-significantly-developed-world-between-1990-and-2014,False,False

You've experienced diarrhea not because of drinking water. That is a common misconception. Diarrhea happens because of bacterial/viral infections, food poisoning/intolerance/allergy, or medications you may be taking. https://www.healthline.com/symptom/diarrhea  2. Drinking 4/L of water is crucial to protect your kidney. ""If the kidneys economize on water, producing a more concentrated urine, these is a greater cost in energy and more wear on their tissues. This is especially likely to occur when the kidneys are under stress, for example when the diet contains excessive amounts of salt or toxic substances that need to be eliminated. Consequently, drinking enough water helps protect this vital organ."" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/  3. Water pH is not the issue. If you don't drink enough water, this causes damage to the kidney's glomeruli and tubules. Your kidney function decreases and progressively will be unable to maintain the acid-base balance. You can develop metabolic acidosis over time. https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/metabolic-acidosis  4. Eating foods high in salt or excessive salt intake over time will lead to high blood pressure. This stiffens and narrows blood vessels. This puts extra pressure on the kidney's glomeruli and tubules which can lead to scarring. This impairs the kidney's job to regulate fluid and can also further increase blood pressure. https://health.clevelandclinic.org/2017/06/kidneys-salt-and-blood-pressure-you-need-a-delicate-balance/",0,2017-11-02T14:18:41.000Z,0.07888888888889999,0.587777777778,en,healthline,https://www.healthline.com/symptom/diarrhea,False,False

First off, let's start when you just brush off the bit about him saying humans have had fat for millennia: you do realize that most of the human brain is saturated fat and studies have come out saying that humans eating meat is what led to homo sapien brain development? In other words, you wouldn't have been able to make the video without humans eating saturated fat during our evolution. So quite literally, fat is one of the essentials for homo sapien existence. Next, yes, heart disease (and you so impressively use ""atherosclerosis"" to impress people) has always been a part of the our existence, however, you also need to look deeper and go into what other civilizations ate. For instance, when pausing that part of the video it says that only 34% of mummies studied had hardened arteries, which is low. Regarding certain diets, sweets have always been an integral part of any society. Honey, more specifically has always been eaten since discovery. There has even been honey discovered in Egyptian tombs. And honey, as I'm sure you know, has such a terrifically high sugar ratio, which gives it it's lovely stickiness. And I understand you highlighted ""hunter gatherer"" but to presume that they didn't have anything sweet is preposterous and ignorant. We have no idea if they liked dessert too, and I can say for certain that as long as bees have been around, so has honey and animals would surely take advantage of this. Not saying it's all sweets and no fat, but mark me I'm certainly not saying it's all fat related. Also, to take into consideration, historically, usually richer, more upper class privileged were usually mummified. And the more upper class you were, the less you worked, the more you indulged in things like food. So how are we to presume that the mummies studied accurately represent the whole of the civilization. Just saying... Also, get off your fucking high horse with telling Adam to lose weight and he eats ""too many baby back ribs"". First of all, usually ribs come slathered with BBQ sauce which is laden with sugar so... (I bet you were made fun of when you were younger, I don't know, maybe you were too scrawny, a little pudgy or made fun of for being vegan so I can see the enjoyment you have in the whole holier than thou routine.) And if you take the ""Eisenhower bit"" as gospel truth with him eating the donut THAT'S RIDICULOUS. It's entertainment, dude.

Here's NASA dumbing it down :  ""Is the sun causing global warming? No. The sun can influence the Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards. One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun’s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun’s energy reaching Earth. A second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting “hotter.”"" http://climate.nasa.gov/faq/?   I'd also mention that solar forcing doesn't explain the observed mesopheric cooling and thermospheric cooling, while increased CO2 + ozone depletion. For example:  ""Evidence of CO2-induced progressive cooling of the middle atmosphere derived from radio observations"" ""Ozone and temperature decadal trends in the stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere, based on measurements from SABER on TIMED""   And here are some scientific papers showing that the Sun did not cause most of the recent global warming, while TSI correlated poorly with recent warming:  ""The Impact of the Revised Sunspot Record on Solar Irradiance Reconstructions"" ""Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate"" ""Deducing Multidecadal Anthropogenic Global Warming Trends Using Multiple Regression Analysis"" ""Global temperature evolution 1979–2010"" ""Spectrally dependent CLARREO infrared spectrometer calibration requirement for climate change detection"" ""Recent oppositely directed trends in solar climate forcings and the global mean surface air temperature"" ""Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century"" ""Evidence of recent causal decoupling between solar radiation and global temperature"" ""Statistical assessments of anthropogenic and natural global climate forcing. An update"" ""Solar trends and global warming"" ""Small influence of solar variability on climate over the past millennium"" ""Quantifying the role of solar radiative forcing over the 20th century"" ""Unusual activity of the Sun during recent decades compared to the previous 11,000 years"" ""Solar variability and global warming: a statistical comparison since 1850"" ""Can solar variability explain global warming since 1970?""     *""This creates rising temperatures as the lack of ionization from cosmic rays dont create clouds during high solar activity cycles.""*  Though cosmic rays likely influenced climate in the past, cosmic rays did not cause the recent global warming period, i.e. the global warming since the mid-20th century. This is discussed in scientific sources such as:  ""Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate"" ""Dynamical evidence for causality between galactic cosmic rays and interannual variation in global temperature"" ""Reply to Luo et al.: Robustness of causal effects of galactic cosmic rays on interannual variation in global temperature"" ""Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements"" ""Long-term global temperature variations under total solar irradiance, cosmic rays, and volcanic activity""",2,2017-07-18T02:37:04.000Z,0.00988492063492,0.24758106575999997,en,nasa,http://climate.nasa.gov/faq/?,False,False

Cryan recently published a study in which two varieties of Bifidobacterium produced by his lab were more effective than escitalopram (Lexapro) at treating anxious and depressive behavior in a lab mouse strain known for pathological anxiety. Although Cryan is optimistic that such findings may point the way to the development of psychobiotics, he is wary of hype. “We still need a lot more research into the mechanisms by which gut bacteria interact with the brain,” he says.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-health-may-depend-on-creatures-in-the-gut/  A decade ago a research team led by Nobuyuki Sudo, now a professor of internal medicine at Kyushu University in Japan, restrained germ-free mice in a narrow tube for up to an hour and then measured their stress hormone output. The amounts detected in the germ-free animals were far higher than those measured in normal control mice exposed to the same restraint. These hormones are released by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in the germ-free mice was clearly dysfunctional. But more important, the scientists also found they could induce more normal hormonal responses simply by pretreating the animals with a single microbe: a bacterium called Bifidobacterium infantis.

Indeed I’d postulate, though this will sound counterintuitive, that hypermasculine men may actually have more in common with hyperfeminine women than with the average man.  I think some of the toxic traits that feminists label “masculine” traits are actually *narcissistic* traits, which are likely shared by narcissistic women (though women may express them somewhat differently). Seeking power over intimate partners, violence, and promiscuity are all traits associated with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and other Cluster B personality disorders. I suspect male narcissists become hypermasculine because hypermasculinity is how men can attract the most attention, while female narcissists become hyperfeminine because hyperfemininity is how women can attract the most attention.  I think it’s fair to say that people are most narcissistic in their teenage years, and people’s experiences interacting with the opposite gender contain a disproportionate number of narcissistic individuals. So the fact that the CMNI is based on opinions from both genders but only young people, while the CFNI is based on the opinions from only women but of a broad age range, is likely to be biased toward detecting more narcissistic traits in masculinity and more healthy traits in femininity.  I don't know how my explanation would be scientifically proven, but I can point to some evidence for it. Some studies suggest that promiscuity (https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/close-encounters/201410/6-myths-about-men-women-and-relationships) and controlling violence toward intimate partners (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21499/full) may be as or more common in women than in men. This is evidence that the CMNI is wrong to label these masculine traits.  Another study found that female-on-male sexual abuse may be associated with hyperfemininity, defined as expecting masculine behaviour from men and viewing female sexuality as a commodity to withhold from men (http://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1046&context=doctoral_dissertations). Feminists often claim that male rapists rape to prove their masculinity; maybe female rapists similarly rape to prove their femininity? Anyway, this study is weak evidence for my hypothesized connection between narcissism, abusiveness, and hyper-gender-conformity.  Another problem with the study that Kristi Winters cites is that it finds only a correlation, which can't tell us the direction of causation. It could be that certain CMNI traits cause mental health issues; but it could also be that mental health issues cause certain CMNI traits; or that some other factor(s) cause both mental health issues and certain CMNI traits. Only three CMNI traits were found to be correlated with mental health issues: Promiscuity, Power over Women, and Self-Reliance. I’ve already argued the first two are caused by a mental health issue (NPD and other Cluster B disorders).  I think Self-Reliance is associated with mental health issues because both are caused by another factor, the greater pressure that society places on males. So just making men less Self-Reliant wouldn’t be enough to stop the mental health issues. We have to remove or reduce the pressures that are causing men to develop Self-Reliance in the first place, not just tell men to stop being Self-Reliant when society is still pressuring them to be so. I agree with you that Mahalik overlooks female agency, and a major reason that Self-Reliance is masculine is because women want to be able to rely on men. To solve that, it’s necessary to change that female expectation.",0,2016-12-31T07:21:30.000Z,0.0977789623312,0.450026652452,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/close-encounters/201410/6-myths-about-men-women-and-relationships),False,False

Generally speaking, it doesn't matter how one presents information to someone with ADHD, as unless their fight-or-flight response is engaged, children with ADHD cannot concentrate on academic subjects.  The real scandal in the mental health community regarding ADHD is not the drugs used to treat the condition (which are generally safe when used _appropriately_), but rather lazy parents who think that, in lieu of parenting, psychostimulants can be used to pacify children that are not sick:  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/saving-normal/201605/adhd-is-overdiagnosed-heres-proof",1,2017-01-09T06:25:25.000Z,0.161904761905,0.489682539683,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/saving-normal/201605/adhd-is-overdiagnosed-heres-proof,False,False

Basically, Creationists are trying to say that God greatly increased the decay rate near the creation of the Earth and then over time decreased the decay rate of almost all radioisotopes thus giving the ""correct"" age of 6,000 years for the Earth. Here are some sources on arguments they made with Helium defusing out of zircon rock. (Btw, sorry. I commented on your Dent fossil print video and I couldn't find the websites...   I remember seeing evidence to discredit it but it has been over a year since I visited the material. But really, just from observing the white layers on the top layer(supposed to be more dense) and how the ""dino"" print doesn't have a white layer under it on many slides but the big toe & most of the foot of the human has a white layer underneath ....basically they were saying that the human weighed more than the dino. Let's just assume that was the case, why was there no white layer under slide 139(I believe it's 139) where the big toe dug in the deepest, yet on on the very same slide  there is a white layer under the four toes where it was obvious ""lighter pressure"" was applied due to the toe prints having such a shallow height compared to the big toe? Not to mention slide 96 where that line cut straight through the center of the ""dino"" print yet the scan showed no white line(higher density) mark under the dino print, but the human footprint maintained the white line underneath(which was the center line of the human foot as well). Suppose the human was running and allow the median part of the foot to be have a scenario for the ability to apply the greatest possible pressure on the ground; why does the dino(where most of his weight is redistributed along the center-line of his foot) have basically no white spots at all underneath? Because, from my conclusion this is a simple baking soda and vinegar trick carving of a dino foot on this rock; and the human foot was either carved or this rock was manufactured and left to set in his shack for 20+ years. Also, why were only allowed to see slides/pictures? Why weren't graphs shown with a density vs. depth and another graph of depth vs. porosity? At the very least he should have released the type of CT scanner he used and given a chart of depth vs. density. Even so, it's irrelevant to say this is less dense or more dense with CT scans if you don't take into account the variable of porosity of the rock. If you have areas in the rock where air pockets formed that of course is going to show a lower density; thus simply showing pictures isn't enough. Anyways....here are the links for arguments about radiometric decay by creationists. Just as a note: If the creationists are indeed correct in that the decay rates where exponentially greater 5-6 thousand years ago compared to today; to fit into that timeline would require that the Earth be completely molten. By using 3 W/m*Celcius(which I checked out..it's a good estimate) average thermal conductivity for the Earth's crust(lithosphere essentially) you end up calculating around 65,000 Celsius/km. Thus at 10 km depth the temp. would be 650,000 Celsius. To put that into perspective...the Earth's core is 6400 km deep and is believed to be around 7000K or ~6700C; so at only 10 km depth the temp. would have been approximately 100 times hotter than the center of the Earth today. I don't know how to calculate the temperature at the surface given this information but I'm pretty sure it's going to be in the 10,000-40,000 Celsius range.

For example, Ball acts as if water vapor is more important to long-term climate change than is CO2. Yet numerous scientists have explained to him why that isn't the case. See, for example:  ""Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature""  Easterbrook is basically a crank who's so bad that his colleagues at Western Washington University pointed out his nonsense.  His ideas usually don't pass peer-review because of evident problems with his claims. So Easterbrook tends to stick to making blogposts on denialist blogs like WattsUpWithThat, and publishing his claims in sources he edits. So he falls under the following discussion:  ""Unlike mainstream climate scientists, who publish primarily in peer reviewed journals, these critics typically employ a range of non-peer-reviewed outlets, ranging from *blogs* to the books we are examining. A large majority—97 of the 108 books—are self-published (33), published by a CTT [conservative think tanks] press (35), published by a conservative (or conservative religious) press (17), or published by a popular press (12), and are thus unlikely to have undergone peer review—particularly by individuals with expertise in climate science. Notably, not a single denial book is published by a university press.[...] *The general lack of peer review allows authors or editors of denial books to make inaccurate assertions that misrepresent the current state of climate science. Like the vast range of other non-peer-reviewed material produced by the denial community, book authors can make whatever claims they wish, no matter how scientifically unfounded.*"" http://abs.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/05/01/0002764213477096.full.pdf  Easterbrook has been debunked, including by some his fellow denialists: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/02/06/on-don-easterbrooks-updated-projection/ https://skepticalscience.com/don-easterbrook-heartland-distortion-of-reality.html   Curry's claims have been rebutted to death, both in the scientific literature and in other sources. For example, see:  ""Comment on “Climate Science and the Uncertainty Monster” by J. A. Curry and P. J. Webster"" ""In defense of the traditional null hypothesis: remarks on the Trenberth and Curry WIREs opinion articles"" https://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/one-of-the-problems-with-judith-curry/ https://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/the-rise-and-fall-of-judith-curry/ http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/08/ipcc-attribution-statements-redux-a-response-to-judith-curry/ http://variable-variability.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Judith%20Curry   Same for Lindzen; for instance:  http://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-scientists-take-on-Richard-Lindzen.html  ""Global warming due to increasing absorbed solar radiation.

I just thought I'd point out that you provide no evidence for any of your claims; incidentally the NASA graph doesn't match either (the actual graph can be found here https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/). As far as temperature rises you are correct: every year could be the hottest on record and have nothing to do with increases in CO2 production from manmade sources. One small problem is how then to account for the temperature rise during a time of decreasing solar activity; i.e. if the sun is going through a period of lower activity how do you account for warming? If you agree that CO2 does have a warming affect maybe then you think that manmade CO2 hasn't had an impact but that naturally occurring sources have? If that's the case have there been major eruptions or perhaps even a flood basalt that has gone unnoticed? Where is all the extra CO2 coming from, (again assuming you except the science of the CO2-temperature link) and is the environment only responding to natural sources of CO2 while somehow managing to avoid being influence from manmade sources?",1,2017-07-13T09:34:53.000Z,-0.009722222222219998,0.5,en,nasa,https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/).,False,False

Monckton et. al. use an energy budget model to get their low climate sensitivity values, as do other people. There are a number of limitations to this model-based approach. These limitations are discussed by Victor Venema, with references to some of the relevant scientific research:  ""Is it time to freak out about the climate sensitivity estimates from energy budget models?"" http://variable-variability.blogspot.com/2016/07/climate-sensitivity-energy-balance-models.html  For further discussion of the energy budget models in a more positive light, see:  ""Inference of Climate Sensitivity from Analysis of Earth's Energy Budget"" https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piers_Forster/publication/301915695_Inference_of_Climate_Sensitivity_from_Analysis_of_Earth's_Energy_Budget/links/574ecaa608aec50945bb2033.pdf  The limitations of energy budget models, along with a number of other mistakes committed by Monckton et. al., cause Monckton et. al. to significantly under-estimate climate sensitivity. This is further explained in:  ""Misdiagnosis of Earth climate sensitivity based on energy balance model results"" http://engine.scichina.com/publisher/scp/journal/SB/60/15/10.1007/s11434-015-0806-z?slug=full%20text  In response to this paper, Monckton et. al. gave the following counter-reply:  ""Keeping it simple: the value of an irreducibly simple climate model"" https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11434-015-0856-2  This counter-reply also fails for a number of reasons, including   1) Monckton et. al. use out-dated RSS data, as opposed to the RSS data that was corrected for diurnal drift in:  ""Sensitivity of Satellite-Derived Tropospheric Temperature Trends to the Diurnal Cycle Adjustment""   2) They don't use the multiple satellite data-sets (RSS, UAH, UW, and STAR) that were corrected for stratospheric cooling. These data-sets show augmented tropospheric warming, reducing the observation-model divergence (for models used by the IPCC) presented by Monckton et. al. It also turns out that UAH is the odd one in the bunch, which is fairly ironic given Monckton's, Christy's, etc. heavy reliance on UAH:  ""Comparing Tropospheric Warming in Climate Models and Satellite Data""   3) Monckton et. al. conveniently leave out a radiosonde temperature record that shows tropospheric warming:  ""Atmospheric changes through 2012 as shown by iteratively homogenized radiosonde temperature and wind data (IUKv2)""   4) In their comparison of models to the satellite/radiosonde data, Monckton et. al. repeat some of the same mistakes committed by Christy in Christy's testimony to Congress. I discussed some of these errors in points 1 to 3.

Accordingly, there's also evidence of the tropopsheric hotpot. For further discussion on this, see:  ""Removing Diurnal Cycle Contamination in Satellite-Derived Tropospheric Temperatures: Understanding Tropical Tropospheric Trend Discrepancies"" ""Atmospheric changes through 2012 as shown by iteratively homogenized radiosonde temperature and wind data (IUKv2)"" ""Comparing Tropospheric Warming in Climate Models and Satellite Data""   6) Monckton et. al. claim that no references have been cited rebutting Lindzen's adaptive iris hypothesis. But such references can easily be provided. For instance:  ""Global warming due to increasing absorbed solar radiation. [...] Many papers refute the negative feedback and iris hypothesis of Lindzen et al. [2001] [e.g., Hartmann and Michelsen, 2002; Randall et al., 2007].""   7) They suggest that the urban heat island (UHI) effect caused much of the recent surface warming. But this fails; UHI does not account for most of the surface warming for a number of reasons: A) When one looks at rural sites, there's statistically significant warming.  B) There wasn't really a statistically significant difference in the warming trend between rural American stations that AGW denialists like Antony Watts like, and stations denialists object to. C) When one corrects for UHI, there's still statistically significant surface warming and most of the observed surface warming remains. D) If UHI was responsible for most of the warming, then one would predict there to be a large discrepancy in the temperature record for windy areas vs. non-windy areas.

Como eu sempre ouvi falar que leite de coco e derivados aumenta o colesterol, eu procurei saber mais e encontrei o seguinte que foi publicado no ""Science Alert"" dos EUA . Usei o google translate para traduzir. Veja:   ORIGINAL EM INGLES:  https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-you-really-need-to-know-about-coconut-oil Aqui está o que você realmente precisa saber sobre o óleo de coco  Nunca foi um ""alimento para a saúde"".  SIGNE DEAN 19 JUN 2017  Você provavelmente já viu as manchetes durante o fim de semana que o óleo de coco do estado é pior para você do que a manteiga, a banha e os drippings de carne.Essas afirmações surgiram na sequência de um novo documento de revisão da American Heart Association (AHA), que fala sobre o papel das gorduras alimentares na redução do risco de doença cardíaca. O óleo de coco recebeu especial atenção nesta revisão, e aqui está o motivo. ""Uma pesquisa recente informou que 72% do público americano classificou o óleo de coco como um"" alimento saudável ""em comparação com 37% dos nutricionistas"", afirma a revisão da AHA.""Esta distância entre opiniões leigas e especializadas pode ser atribuída à comercialização de óleo de coco na imprensa popular"".  Na verdade, o óleo de coco foi promovido para promover a perda de peso, facilitar a digestão e até aumentar o seu metabolismo. Mas dado que o óleo de coco contém uma enorme gordura saturada de 82 por cento, é lógico que ele realmente entraria na categoria de gorduras não tão boas para você.   Como explicamos em abril:    ""A razão pela qual é aconselhável evitar gorduras saturadas é a respeito do colesterol no sangue, o material ceroso que pode se acumular em suas artérias. Todo o colesterol não é o mesmo, porém - há uma distinção entre lipoproteína de alta densidade"" boa ""( HDL) e ""mau"" colesterol de lipoproteínas de baixa densidade (LDL).     O conselho padrão diz que, se sua dieta tiver muita gordura saturada - pense junk food, bolos, alimentos processados, chips - o colesterol LDL pode aumentar e aumentar o risco de doença cardíaca "".  Nós normalmente associamos gorduras saturadas com produtos de origem animal, como manteiga e banha, enquanto as fontes de gorduras não saturadas são coisas como o azeite, nozes e sementes. O óleo de coco diminui essa tendência porque é um óleo vegetal com um teor de gordura saturada muito alto, mas também possui um perfil molecular complicado - os vários ácidos graxos contribuem de forma diferente ao colesterol no sangue. De acordo com a última revisão da AHA, estudos mostraram que o óleo de coco realmente aumenta o colesterol no sangue, tanto o LDL quanto o tipo HDL.  Mas os pesquisadores também apontam que ""as mudanças no colesterol HDL causado pela dieta ou tratamentos medicamentosos não podem mais estar diretamente ligadas a mudanças na doença cardiovascular"", então o que realmente precisamos prestar atenção é se um alimento levanta LDL ou não. O óleo de coco faz isso, embora isso não signifique que ele aumenta diretamente o risco de doença cardíaca. Mas a ligação indireta entre colesterol ""ruim"" e doenças cardiovasculares ainda está lá, então a revisão basicamente aconselha você a evitar o uso de óleo de coco.  A coisa é, não é como se nossa compreensão do óleo de coco mudasse durante a noite, como alguns relatórios de mídia fazem parecer.O que AHA se preocupa é a redução do risco de doença cardiovascular através de umsom, aconselhamento baseado em evidências para o público. Se eles têm evidências científicas para recomendar que você troque alguns alimentos para que outros consigam esse objetivo, eles irão. E a evidência existe - quando as pessoas trocam gorduras saturadas com gorduras insaturadas em sua dieta, sua incidência de doenças cardiovasculares diminui em cerca de 30%.  ""Os pesquisadores derrubaram centenas de trabalhos de pesquisa publicados desde a década de 1950, encontrando evidências que sustentam a recomendação da AHA de que a gordura saturada deve constituir menos de 10% das calorias diárias para americanos saudáveis"", afirma AHA em um comunicado à imprensa. No final, esta revisão realmente não muda muito em termos de conselhos dietéticos - se você gosta de adicionar óleo de coco à sua dieta, considere um deleite e mantenha seus níveis de consumo no mínimo. ""Evidências acumuladas durante os últimos anos que reforçam as recomendações de AHA de longa data para substituir as gorduras saturadas por gorduras poliinsaturadas e monoinsaturadas para diminuir a incidência de doenças cardiovasculares"", afirma a revisão.  Coma muitas frutas frescas e vegetais, retire os alimentos processados ​​e tente evitar gorduras saturadas para reduzir o risco de doença cardíaca, optando pelo uso de óleos vegetais. E talvez deixe o óleo de coco para aplicações cosméticas - aparentemente, é um ótimo condicionador de cabelo.  A revisão foi publicada na revista Circulation da American Heart Association.

Pollution in moderation? The wasting of food for livestock feed in moderation?   There is a huge problem with the livestock industry. Because of the second law of thermodynamics, it will always be less efficient to eat the animals rather than eat their food. Animals can waste up to 98% of the energy fed to them. Even chickens waste at least 70%(http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat).

This mineral has such a strong affinity for DNA and many proteins that it is used in modern labs sometimes to purify these molecules. Because this dinosaur bone has been sitting in the ground for 65 million years, the likelihood is high that if DNA were actively sought, it could be found, just because certain biomolecules, including DNA, stick like Velcro to the mineral. However, the challenge isn’t necessarily in finding DNA, it’s in making a strong case that the DNA is dinosaurian in origin by ruling out other sources. Is it possible that we may someday recover authentic DNA from dinosaur bone? The scientific answer is “yes”…..all things are possible until disproven. Have we disproven this possibility? No. Have we recovered “authentic” dinosaur DNA? No. Therefore, it is an open question.",0,2016-12-28T22:06:56.000Z,0.178841269841,0.6568730158730001,pt,sciencemag,http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/signs-ancient-cells-and-proteins-found-dinosaur-fossils,False,False

Their fats and meats were also from wild animals that lived and foraged in a cold climate. They got lots of unsaturated fats, vitamins, and omega-3 from the fat, skin, meat, organs, and stomachs. By contrast, our slaughterhouse animals have more saturated fat and omega-6.  Also, although they had relatively good heart health, the inuit had a very high rate of osteoporosis as a result of their high intake of animal protein. Plant protein, on the other hand, does not rob the bones as much. http://www.encognitive.com/node/4803",0,2016-11-29T05:44:46.000Z,0.127,0.590777777778,en,discovermagazine,http://discovermagazine.com/2004/oct/inuit-paradox,True,False

While there isn't specific research on vegans and Lyme disease - probably because the amount of people with Lyme disease that are vegan is super low - there are significant connections to be made. Most notably is inflammation as a pathogenesis in Lyme disease, meaning the more dangerous parts of Lyme disease are caused by inflammation. For example, nervous system issues: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150416084338.htm Animal products have the highest levels of arachidonic acid of which high levels are strongly linked to inflammation. - Levels in foods: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/diet/foodsources/fatty_acids/table4.html - Inflammation link: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid/ This is likely the main reason that vegan diets have lower levels of inflammation, in addition to the anti-inflammatory benefits of increasing plant consumption. As this gut study says, the healthier vegan gut may be explained by reduced levels of inflammation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245565/ As Dr. Greger says here, ""most studies done to date on those eating vegetarian or vegan have found lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers in their bodies."" http://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/13/dietary-treatment-for-crohns-disease/ Which explains why a vegan diet is helpful for Crohn's which is an autoimmune disease as well. To tie it all together, people have treated Lyme disease with a vegan diet and achieved good results, though they are anecdotal.  1. A quote from one woman's doctor: “I am releasing you. You are the only person I released from my Lyme patients.” She said, “You have done it through food. I am now doing that with other patients.""http://www.vega-licious.com/healing-lyme-disease-with-a-plant-based-diet/ 2.

Compared to a decrease in acne for female contraception. 15% report muscle pain: also compared to a  decrease in muscle pain for women on birth control 33% experience mood disorders including depression. Something that is non-existent in female birth control. Most men recovered fertility rates after a few weeks and some took up to a year to return to baseline levels. Some have yet to recover. Also non-existent in female birth control. You don't think that a suicide couldnt be related to ANY of the above? then you a fucking moron.  Go ahead and study male contraception. But ultimately its safer to use a condom or for the woman to use some. In fact it actually improves most women's health.

The main issue is brain complexity; roughly how many neurons the brain in question has. This can be tricky. For example there are many conditions that will cause a human to have a simpler brain, a brain that is smaller because its total number of neurons is less. These people tend to be less intelligent. (Even here there are issues, witness this woman from China missing a good sixth of her brain mass ( http://www.livescience.com/47802-missing-crucial-brain-part-went-unnoticed.html  ) while suffering little dimminishment of intelligence (Though far more in motor skills.)  However when breed (and species) size comes into play cells themselves tend to be larger or smaller,. Thus dog brains tend to be equally complex, but a Great Dane's has the same number of larger cells than a toy poodle.  On top of THIS there are genetic defects due to inbreeding that affect many breeds, unsurprisingly those affecting intelligence are allowed to persist in breeds where this is not considered an important trait. Such defects tend to not reflect the breed as a whole however any more than one could claim Golden Retrievers are naturally arthritic.  Furthermore a dog's physical limitations affect how it sees the world and develops. A chihuahua is going to be smaller and weaker than most things it encounters while a pitbull is more evenly matched. Two identically-minded dogs would be expected to develop quite differently under those conditions.  On top of all of this are the environments dogs are raised in. You are not going to use a toy poodle to herd sheep so you wouldn't expect to ever come across a poodle that could; the entire breed is essentially blocked from the environment where those skills would be picked up. It is hard to understate this effect; many breeds are almost entirely inside dogs and certain skills, such as tracking scents tend to become unlearnable outside of puppyhood (The 'old dog\new tricks' effect.)  Because of these issues, while nearly all dogs have the same potential and basic personality breeds do have differences, sometimes stark ones largely due to the environment they find themselves in.",1,2016-10-11T04:58:48.000Z,0.129426406926,0.459956709957,en,livescience,http://www.livescience.com/47802-missing-crucial-brain-part-went-unnoticed.html,False,False

Consider the first hole, it is being pulled left by a big pile of stuff and right by second hole AND a big pile of stuff. So it will head towards the second hole-stuff pile. To counter this you might make the first pile of stuff bigger, but then IT is pulling harder on the second hole (with the first hole pulling too.) so the *second* hole heads towards the first AND the stuff pile.  On one side your 1st pile of stuff is pulling on hole 1, you, hole 2 and the other pile of stuff.  The 2nd pile of stuff is doing the same thing, the other way round. Both piles are thus moving together.  So what you get is two holes moving together (but always staying the same distance away from you) AND two piles of stuff 'behind' them also moving together.  Now let's say the holes are merging and you're inside. Let's say you fire two big masses with your railguns at both holes to try and push them apart. But the stuff you shoot also has mass, the more you want to push the holes, the more mass it must have. So it also has gravity and makes  the holes bigger when it hits. SO when it hits the holes may, for a short time, stop moving together, but they get bigger too, putting you deeper inside both.  The 'horizontal gravity' can be quite weak in two large, merging holes, it gets stronger the further from the special point you are, reaching light speed escape velocity where the two holes' horizons meet. This is a rel phenomenon known as a 'lagrangian point' and any two objects have  five ( http://www.space.com/30302-lagrange-points.html ) we've even put satellites at some in the Earth-sun system. The one discussed here is 'L1' and is known to be unstable. (As are L2 and L3) We have actually done your black hole thought experiment with real spacecraft. (And a less dangerous mass.)",0,2016-09-14T10:38:47.000Z,0.0324002574003,0.316055341055,en,space,http://www.space.com/30302-lagrange-points.html,False,False

The water contained in icebergs is colder and fresh water, so the ocean and fresh water do not  mix completely; the differences in density cause sea levels to rise slightly about 0.049 millimeters per year. Fresh water is less dense than salty sea water so even though the amount of sea water displaced by the iceberg is equal to its weight, the melted fresh water will take up a slightly larger volume than the displaced salt water.   http://education.seattlepi.com/effect-global-warming-icebergs-4877.html  https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18841-melting-icebergs-boost-sea-level-rise/",0,2016-10-18T01:16:46.000Z,0.156666666667,0.438333333333,en,newscientist,https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18841-melting-icebergs-boost-sea-level-rise/,False,False

They didn’t claim it evolved from the t3SS idiot. They both evolved from a common ancestor…""  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAH  First of all, let's disspell your LIE. Kenneth Miller, as well as his fellow advocates, DO CLAIM that the TS3 is a precursor of the bacterial flagellum. Secondly, the idea that they have a ""common ancestor"" is GARBAGE, for if you take away one part of the bacterial flagellum, it becomes entirely non-functional, as it is irreducibly complex. In my previous comment, I crushed Kenneth Miller's pseudoscience, by showing that the basal of the bacterial flagellum is highly dissimilar to the TS3, and I also shown that the bacterial flagellum predates the TS3. You wanted a citation. Before I get to that in a second though, you wrote ""proven in a federal court"". The judge was an evolutionist and this verdict was largely based on concessions by Behe that are no longer held based on further evidence. Continuing...  You wanted a citation for Scott Minnichs showing the bacterial flagellum comes first. But before I give you Minnichs citations, I'll give you citations and evidence from EVOLUTIONISTS.  ""Based on patchy taxonomic distribution of the T3SS compared to that of the flagellum, widespread in bacterial phyla, previous phylogenetic analyses proposed that T3SS derived from a flagellar ancestor and spread through lateral gene transfers."" -(Sophie S. Abby and Eduardo P.C. Rocha, ""An Evolutionary Analysis of the Type III Secretion System"" (2012).)  ""One fact in favour of the flagellum-first view is that bacteria would have needed propulsion before they needed T3SSs, which are used to attack cells that evolved later than bacteria. Also, flagella are found in a more diverse range of bacterial species than T3SSs. ""The most parsimonious explanation is that the T3SS arose later,"" says biochemist Howard Ochman at the University of Arizona in Tucson."" https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726431.900-uncovering-the-evolution-of-the-bacterial-flagellum/  Now, although I am not directly aware of a paper by Scott on this, Scott has published a NUMBER of papers on the bacterial flagellum, making him very credible on this issue. See: http://jb.asm.org/search?author1=Scott+A.+Minnich&sortspec=date&submit=Submit  I was referred to by a molecular biologist on Scott's lecture that you can find on YouTube where he *proves* all this, and entirely debunks the TS3 as a precursor in a number of ways. You should watch it -- it's called 'Paradigm of Design - Bacterial Flagellum'.  Lastly, although the flagellum is *slightly* flexible in its composition between bacteria, at least 75% of the entire bacterial flagellum is built on parts found nowhere in any other evolutionary mechanism -- so please tell me, where exactly are you going to borrow these parts from for the flagellum to evolve?  Anyways, you finally stopped denying the BGV Theorem establishes an absolute beginning after I pounded you with citations and resources (I had another slew of citations ready in case you were going to continue your nonsense in this comment). Indeed, it seems you finally, and entirely conceded that the universe has an absolute beginning, as literally ALL the evidence shows, as I quoted earlier from Vilenkin.  ""The General Theory of Relativity and the discovery of the expansion of the universe shattered the old picture of an ever existing and ever lasting universe"" -Stephen Hawking  I have only one problem with your claims though:  ""The General Theory of Relativity and the discovery of the expansion of the universe shattered the old picture of an ever existing and ever lasting universe""  This commits a fallacy of equivocation, by saying ""if God doesn't need a cause, nor does the multiverse"". Obviously useless and fallacious logic. Furthermore, the universe/multiverse (whichever one you want, I don't care, as long as a beginning is conceded, I'll reference it as the universe from here on out) had an absolute beginning -- God did not, and thus there can be no comparison.

As far as your comment is concerned: 1. ""Do you realize how much more land would have to be taken to sustain an entire population of vegans?"" This would be something to consider if farm animals didn't eat way more than 7 billion vegan humans would. The problem is they do. http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S.full 2. ""Do you understand the affects of animal over population"" What animal overpopulation? If you're talking about farm animals, demand would take care of that (if demand goes down, fewer animals are bred). If you're talking about wild animals such as deer, the only reason there is an increase in population of these animals is that humans kill their natural predators such as wolves so that they don't kill cattle. Let's stop killing predators and there won't be any overpopulation. 3. ""What about the wood that serves as the frame of your house, something that probably came from a lumber business that is doing nothing but helping in deforestation."" If you're worried about deforestation, one of the main reasons the Rainforest is fucked up is farming, funnily enough. At least I'm not contributing to that. 4. ""Maybe in that case you should live in a metal framed building then. Or better, not have a house!"" I don't see how my being homeless would help reduce animal suffering. Personally I'm interested in practical and realistic solutions. Buying beans instead of chicken when I'm at the supermarket doesn't constitute a huge inconvenience for me and helps reduce the demand for animal products. My becoming homeless because my house is made of wood would be a massive problem in my life (because for example I need an address to work and pay taxes) and wouldn't help the animals affected by deforestation, since I didn't create demand for wooden houses (I don't own the place and I'm not planning on ever buying my own place).

It's just Low Carb. Almost all of it is low carb high protein. Your method is flawed. Ketogentic diets are High Fat low Net Carbs. Second, most of the so called studies are not trial studies. They make assumptions that the research they did is valid. Almost every study you linked, links to another study that say may or could but are not trail analysis. That is not real research or evidence that assumptions.   Comparison of low- and high-carbohydrate diets for type 2 diabetes management: a randomized trial. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26224300 Both diets achieved substantial weight loss and reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose. The LC diet, which was high in unsaturated fat and low in saturated fat, achieved greater improvements in the lipid profile, blood glucose stability, and reductions in diabetes medication requirements, suggesting an effective strategy for the optimization of T2D management.  Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of the effects of low carbohydrate diets on cardiovascular risk factors http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.01021.x/abstract;jsessionid=7396D07C42DB2B84642D35158B132AF9.d04t04 LCD was shown to have favourable effects on body weight and major cardiovascular risk factors; however the effects on long-term health are unknown.  Dietary carbohydrate restriction as the first approach in diabetes management: Critical review and evidence base http://www.nutritionjrnl.com/article/S0899-9007(14)00332-3/abstract1 Low carbohydrate diets should be the first point of attack in managing Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, a new study suggests. The study suggests the need for a reappraisal of dietary guidelines due to the inability of current recommendations to control the epidemic of diabetes. The authors point to the specific failure of the prevailing low-fat diets to improve obesity, cardiovascular risk or general health, and to the persistent reports of serious side effects of commonly prescribed diabetes medications.  Evidence from randomised controlled trials did not support the introduction of dietary fat guidelines in 1977 and 1983: a systematic review and meta-analysis http://openheart.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000196.full.pdf+html Dietary recommendations were introduced for 220 million US and 56 million UK citizens by 1983, in the absence of supporting evidence from RCTs.  Association of Dietary, Circulating, and Supplement Fatty Acids With Coronary Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1846638 Current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats.  Relationship of Insulin Resistance and Related Metabolic Variables to Coronary Artery Disease: A Mathematical Analysis http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/2/361.abstract Insulin resistance is likely the most important single cause of CAD. A better understanding of its pathogenesis and how it might be prevented or cured could have a profound effect on CAD.  Low carbohydrate diet in type 1 diabetes, long-term improvement and adherence: A clinical audit. http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/22650646/Low_carbohydrate_diet_in_type_1_diabetes_long_term_improvement_and_adherence:_A_clinical_audit_ Attending an educational course on dietary carbohydrate reduction and corresponding insulin reduction in type 1 diabetes gave lasting improvement. About half of the individuals adhered to the program after 4 years. The method may be useful in informed and motivated persons with type 1 diabetes. The number needed to treat to have lasting effect in 1 was 2.  Type 2 diabetes as an inflammatory disease. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21233852 Components of the immune system are altered in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), with the most apparent changes occurring in adipose tissue, the liver, pancreatic islets, the vasculature and circulating leukocytes. These immunological changes include altered levels of specific cytokines and chemokines, changes in the number and activation state of various leukocyte populations and increased apoptosis and tissue fibrosis. Together, these changes suggest that inflammation participates in the pathogenesis of T2D. Preliminary results from clinical trials with salicylates and interleukin-1 antagonists support this notion and have opened the door for immunomodulatory strategies for the treatment of T2D that simultaneously lower blood glucose levels and potentially reduce the severity and prevalence of the associated complications of this disease.  Type 2 Diabetes: Inflammation, Not Obesity, Cause Of Insulin Resistance https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071106133106.htm Researchers have discovered that inflammation provoked by immune cells called macrophages leads to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Their discovery may pave the way to novel drug development to fight the epidemic of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity, the most prevalent metabolic disease worldwide.  Neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects of the ketogenic diet http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2367001/ there is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, and may also be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.  Complex carbs cause more inflammation over simple dietary sugars. Comparison with ancestral diets suggests dense acellular carbohydrates promote an inflammatory microbiota, and may be the primary dietary cause of leptin resistance and obesity http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402009/ Elevating dietary fat in a Western diet can cause obesity. However, the effects of low-carbohydrate diets and the failure of low-fat diets to match their ad libitum weight loss and metabolic effects indicate that carbohydrates somehow play a central role as initiators of leptin resistance in humans.",0,2016-12-14T19:09:41.000Z,0.0498887509549,0.405247167049,en,sciencedaily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071106133106.htm,True,False

The animals that ate artificially sweetened yogurt not only gained more weight, they also appeared to lose their natural ability to keep track of the extra calories and eat less later on. 'It's a Pavlovian approach to obesity,' Davidson says. 'Animals learn to use taste to predict caloric consequences, and in nature, sweetness is almost always an indicator of calories.' When we experience a sweet taste with no accompanying caloric intake, it confuses that calibration tool.

Let me start.   Many crops grown in poorer countries are sold to the West to support the cattle industry.   Worldwide, cows consume around 45 billion gallons of water a day, and eat around 135 billion pounds of feed a day, that's enough to feed 10 billion people. Getting rid of animal agriculture would be the best thing that happened to humanity in a long time. Not to mention, stopping the consumption of animal products would save tons of land, including rain forests which 91% of have been lost in order to feed livestock. Much less land can be used to feed the world with foods that contain the necessary macro and micronutrients. What im about to tell you says it all.   1.5 acres can produce 37, 000lbs of plant based food.  while  1.5 acres can produce 375lbs of meat.  Ask yourself which one is more sustainable.

Stopping between the cornfields and the primary school playground, the  workers dumped buckets of bubbling white liquid onto the ground. Then  they turned around and drove right back through the gates of their  compound without a word.  This ritual has been going on almost every day for nine months, Li and other villagers said.  In China, a country buckling with the breakneck pace of its industrial  growth, such stories of environmental pollution are not uncommon. But  the Luoyang Zhonggui High-Technology Co., here in the central plains of  Henan Province near the Yellow River, stands out for one reason: It's a  green energy company, producing polysilicon destined for solar energy  panels sold around the world. But the byproduct of polysilicon  production -- silicon tetrachloride -- is a highly toxic substance that  poses environmental hazards.  ""The land where you dump or bury it  will be infertile. No grass or trees will grow in the place. . . . It is  like dynamite -- it is poisonous, it is polluting.

Revolutionary!  Oh wait, you haven't?  Neither has anyone else.  Silicon is, as you said,  &quot;a commonly available material&quot;, but in it&#39;s raw form it doesn't provide any energy.  To work as a PV panel it must be mined, melted, formed into crystals, cut, etched, polished, wired, packaged and delivered.  Are you really so naive that you think this is a CLEAN process?  Poor child.  Not only does it take quite a bit of energy (The first 5 years of the PVs power generation can be considered a pay back of the energy required to make it), but it also requires a number of very nasty chemicals.  And, despite the ""clean manufacturing"" standards in place here, guess where 6 of the top 10 PV panel manufacturers do their dirty work?  In China, where they are free to dump the acids, pollute the water, burn the dirty energy(Sans filters, of course!), and otherwise create a nightmare of chemical by-products.  Solar advocates like to refer to the &quot;carbon subsidy&quot;, where the cleanup of the by-products of coal/fuel/etc are part of it's total cost, but solar has the same kind of by-products, but worse.

Só vi 3 da efedrina ai em cima, nenhum da cafeína. Um trata sobre perda de peso, e os outros não. Um cita estudo onde diz que a perda de peso é modesta, e a curto prazo ( essa é a evidencia sobre ela no geral). E eu não disse que a efedrina não faz perder peso, eu disse que as evidências dela sao até mais favoráveis, por ser uma droga, e não considerada suplemento (aqui no Brasil não).   Perda de peso para efedrina não é considerado nivel A de evidência. Precisa-se pesquisar mais ainda (não é a toa que os estudos não param).  Veja: efedrina é POSSIVELMENTE EFICAZ:  http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-847-ephedra.aspx?activeingredientid=847&activeingredientname=ephedra  Nivel B de evidencia: (o q nao é ruim de tudo)  Na pesquisa humana, efedrina causou perda de peso, quando utilizado em combinação com a cafeína. A pesquisa sobre a efedrina sozinha é limitado e os resultados são mistos. As quantidades de efedrina em produtos comercialmente disponíveis variou muito e inúmeros efeitos adversos foram relatados. Mais pesquisas são necessárias.  http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ephedra--ma-huang/evidence/hrb-20059270  No entanto os riscos dela superam os pequenos benefícios a curto prazo, como diz o FDA (importante um médico saber disso antes avaliar tal indicação):  https://nccih.nih.gov/health/ephedra  Já As revisões da cafeína pura nao sugerem perda de peso. Ela associada a efedrina, q é uma substancia que apesar de pouco fazer perder peso, dá resultados. (não só as evidencias da cafeína sao ruins, mas de qualquer outro termogênico sem associação a drogas). No caso dela mais efedrina há uma associação mais positiva (o que tb nao quer dizer muita coisa).  Alias, dizer se é termogenico ou nao é complicado pq nem ANVISA dá uma definição clara disso. Aqui no Brasil nao existe categoria para suplementos. São apenas alimentos. E com bastante propaganda enganosa. Basta ler a legislação.  Sobre a farmacologia? Mecanismo de ação seria o menos importante já que isso é determinado in vitro, e nos estamos discutindo a parte clínica (testando-a nos pacientes para saber a relevância disso ou EFETIVIDADE). Nem sempre os efeitos, comprovados de mecanismos funcionam bem na pratica (sao eficazes, mas nao efetivos). E de farmacologia, eu entendo.   Até o momento em revisões sérias sobre o assunto nao vi nada demais.  Milhares de pessoas tb dizem que tribulus funciona pra aumentar  testosterona.

Obvious enough, anyone can understand this.Global Cooling: Global Warming, only a downwards trend instead of upwards.Climate: The average patterns seen in weather. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the classical period is 30 years.Climate Change: A noticeable difference in the climate, typically visible either in raw numbers or climate models like temperature maps. Another good indicator is if weather patterns show a strong difference, like rain in the Acatama Desert, for example.

A study done by the Justice Department’s authoritative National Crime Victimization from the years 1995 to 2016 showed that the rate of sexual based crimes, including rape, has dropped by 44%! Quite steadily too. ( This study contradicted the 1990's protests where the porn industry was being targeted by anti-porn activists who claimed that X-rated media would  spur men to commit sexual assault. On the contrary, the results of  this “natural experiment”—evidence before and after social changes—showed that said activists where VERY wrong.)  So in reality, having pornography available has actually helped prevent sexual based crimes. And since it is a well know fact that rape in prison is a serious problem, especially for men, logic would dictate that maybe allowing porn in prison would actually help lower the cases of sexually based crimes with in prison.   Oh... wait... Now I see why Feminists hate the idea. Because it would help MEN as well as women! And  it would actually do some good in the world... Right. My mistake.

This ability to absorb and re-emit infrared energy is what makes CO2 an effective heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Not all gas molecules are able to absorb IR radiation. For example, nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), which make up more than 90% of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb infrared photons. CO2 molecules can vibrate in ways that simpler nitrogen and oxygen molecules cannot, which allows CO2molecules to capture the IR photons.  http://scied.ucar.edu/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation  1. The atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide, 96.5% by volume. Most of the remaining 3.5% is nitrogen. Early evidence pointed to the sulfuric acid content in the atmosphere, but we now know that that is a rather minor constituent of the atmosphere. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/venusenv.html  3.The greenhouse effect works like this: Energy arrives from the sun in the form of visible light[, heat,] and ultraviolet radiation.  The Earth then emits some of this energy as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 'capture' some of thisheat, then re-emit it in all directions - including back to the Earth's surface. http://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm  I have all the time in the world.﻿",0,2015-11-17T13:07:41.000Z,0.338888888889,0.458333333333,en,skepticalscience,http://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm,False,False

I apparently have to explain to you theory of greenhouse gases, which defy particle physics. No, greenhouse gasses do not conduct heat, that would produce the opposite of a greenhouse gas, that would produce a cooling gas. C02 is claimed to be unusual infrared absorber, which in some convoluted magical nonsense is supposedly heating up the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, by magically not absorbing enough infrared radiation when it comes from the sun to impact global temperatures, but then after the suns radiation has reached the earth and is heating it up, it suddenly magically starts to absorb infrared radiation in the opposite direction in enough quantities to impact global temperatures. http://scied.ucar.edu/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation  3. Oh, my god, you&#39;ve got something right, climatologists claims of greenhouse gasses indeed has got nothing to do with density; WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE DEAD WRONG! The morons seem to mistake infrared radiation for heat, IR is not heat, IR in the consequence of heat. Heat is the kinetic energy of particles. In order to keep temperature of gasses high, you need particle collision, magnetism via the electron clouds giving the particles a new impulse.

The Platypus was just an simple example of mammals that could benefit from feathers.

So this was the first real proof.  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/feathered-dinosaur-tail-amber-theropod-myanmar-burma-cretaceous/",0,2016-12-23T00:30:27.000Z,0.190909090909,0.470043290043,en,nationalgeographic,http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/feathered-dinosaur-tail-amber-theropod-myanmar-burma-cretaceous/,False,False

So basically they're just killing animals because they've been _told_ they should be accountable to this God.  _you are forgetting one thing that's root to all of this...

These differences in conversion efficiency may be due to the genetic variability in ß-carotene metabolism of individual human subjects. Therefore, provitamin A carotenoids might not be a good vitamin A source for those subjects of the poor converter phenotype.   https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-11-genetic-link-vitamin-deficiency.html  However, Dr Lietz’ latest research - published in the FASEB Journal and presented this month at the 2nd Hohenheim Nutrition Conference in Stuttgart - shows that for many women, beta-carotene is not an effective substitute for vitamin A.   https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/beta-carotene-conversion-to-vitamin-a/  Almost half of Caucasians (and a slightly smaller percentage of other populations)  have polymorphisms in their BCMO1 gene that causes either a 30% or almost 70% decrease in the amount of vitamin A that they get from beta carotene foods and supplements.  http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/6/1545.full Conclusion: Variable absorption and conversion of ß-carotene to vitamin A both contribute to the variable response to consumption of ß-carotene. Our double-tracer approach is adaptable for identifying efficient converters of carotenoid to retinoid.  Both absorption and conversion to vitamin A contributed to the variable plasma response to ingested ß-carotene in our small group of subjects. Genetic factors may have also played a role (52) and the low-responder trait may be a stable characteristic (10, 11). Our results are relevant to ß-carotene supplementation programs to relieve vitamin A deficiency, to improve vitamin A nutritional status (2, 8, 15, 16), and to confer antioxidant protection (33). Our double-tracer protocol could be adapted to identify and screen for individuals and populations that can benefit from ß-carotene supplementation programs.  https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-saga/ https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-vagary/ http://empoweredsustenance.com/true-vitamin-a-foods/ http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/beta-carotene-vitamin-a-myth Why you can’t get vitamin A from eating vegetables  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091118072051.htm Almost half of UK women could be suffering from a lack of vitamin A due to a previously undiscovered genetic variation, scientists at Newcastle University have found.    but i digress  A is not converted from genes that many carry and those that can it should not be relied upon so no A in a vegan diet...   lets look at D sun exposure ! always sun when you have no clue of how it works you must have cholesterol levels to do this, with all vegans being hypocholesteronemia you do not produce vitamin D well, the only vegan source is mushrooms   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098082 CONCLUSION: Non-vegetarians had severe vitamin D deficiency, while vegetarians had vitamin D insufficiency irrespective of belonging to urban or rural area.  http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/08/10/making-sense-of-your-cholesterol-numbers.aspx Vitamin D and Your Cholesterol You probably are aware of the incredible influence of vitamin D on your health. If you aren't, or need a refresher, you can visit my vitamin D page. What most people do not realize is that the best way to obtain your vitamin D is from safe exposure to sun on your skin. The UVB rays in sunlight interact with the cholesterol on your skin and convert it to vitamin D. Bottom line?

Moreover, phytate was one of the strongest inhibitory predictors of calcium, iron and zinc bioavailability.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long CONCLUSION   The iron and zinc from vegetarian diets are generally less bioavailable than from nonvegetarian diets because of reduced meat intake as well as the tendency to consume more phytic acid and other plant-based inhibitors of iron and zinc absorption. However, in Western countries with varied and abundant food supplies, it is not clear that this reduced bioavailability has any functional consequences. Although vegetarians tend to have lower iron stores than omnivores, they appear to have no greater incidence of iron deficiency anemia. With current methods, it is not possible to effectively evaluate the influence of vegetarian diets on zinc nutrition because there are no reliable and sensitive criteria to identify marginal zinc nutriture in humans. The effectiveness of trace element supplementation of vegetarian diets has not been demonstrated, and any recommendations for supplementation should consider potential adverse effects, including possible competitive interactions between minerals. Research to further define the functional consequences of low iron stores without anemia and to sensitively detect marginal zinc status is needed to detect and prevent any possible problems associated with lower iron and zinc absorption from vegetarian diets.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17299475 CONCLUSIONS: In this population, fracture risk was similar for meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians.

Assuming the sources I've found are credible, then it doesn't seem like green or brown eyes have any relation or similarities to how blue eyes came around. So in this regard you probably wouldn't achieve much by comparing them.    Blue eyes though seems to have come around about 6-10k years ago according to the sources, and are from the same ancestor. What caused it I don't know, other than from an mutation. For the mutation to have happened because of inbreeding though, could be possible, since if I remember correctly, inbreeding are more likely to cause mutation (and that being the reason for it to be bad). With that said, it seems more likely that inbreeding invite too much mutation, and end out in a child to mutated to survive.    About the cause for the spread of it, the two hypothesizes as of right now (according to the sources) are either because of the attractiveness of the feat, or it being a side effect of an advantage that caused it. The first of the two, about the attractiveness, would make it that the feat would make the owner of it wanted by many/most of the opposite sex (something I would hope to believe being an owner of blue eyes myself :P ), and then the spread more likely not caused of inbreeding, but I guess rather excessive breeding. The other, about it coming with an advantage would not make inbreeding directly cause the spread, but not leave it out either.  The conclusion being that from what I found, it's possible the birth of the trait could be caused because of inbreeding, but seems unlikely to be the cause of the spread.  PS.

Granted, I'm only 19, but I've spent the last 3 years researching this and taking biology and chemistry classes at a private university where I have a 4.0 GPA (That means I get all A's, since you obviously have never gone to college), and I've found the evidence shows that 95% of all children who get a vaccine are fine, and that 5% (And I'm being extremely liberal with that estimation) will experience side effects, most of which are caused by an allergic reaction, and so the blame can't be put on the vaccine. ""Start thing for yourself"" If you can't take the time to proof-read your own argument, I can't take you seriously. This shows me you are unwilling to look at any view other than your own, and even then you won't look at it too deeply. I am constantly questioning my own decisions, this is the only way to make sure what you do is right. The only difference I can imagine that's between my questions and yours is that I ask myself what does the evidence show, and it shows, for the majority, vaccines are safe. ""They are not Reputable companies!"" I pray they aren't. I also pray they aren't reputable churches, stores, refrigerators, and reptile overlords. The CDC and FDA are parts of the government, tasked with making sure the American people are safe and well. If they fail at their job, US citizens die, and then there's no one left for the government to rule over. It makes no sense for them to be purposely falsifying so much evidence (that the scientific community agrees with) when it puts their own power at risk. I will make you my usual deal. You find me one real, reputable source proving vaccines are unsafe (Not a source designed to make you feel a certain way, or that cherry picks data to make it look like something is happening, or that outright lies) and I will gladly send you 50 US dollars. When you are unable to find a single source that does this, you have to accept vaccines are safe. Also, here's a link to my favorite source that talks about how vaccines are safe. Every blue word takes you to another source that proves vaccines are safe or that people saying otherwise are wrong: http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/dear-parents-you-are-being-lied",0,2016-04-21T23:28:15.000Z,0.12793040293,0.58359025234,en,iflscience,http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/dear-parents-you-are-being-lied,False,False

Official documents obtained from the UK Department of Health (DH) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) reveal that the British health authorities have been engaging in such practice for the last 30 years, apparently for the sole purpose of protecting the national vaccination program.  The author, Dr Lucija Tomljenovic writes:  Here I present the documentation which appears to show that the JCVI made continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and contraindications to vaccinations to both parents and health practitioners in order to reach overall vaccination rates which they deemed were necessary for “herd immunity”, a concept which with regards to vaccination, and contrary to prevalent beliefs, does not rest on solid scientific evidence as will be explained. As a result of such vaccination policy promoted by the JCVI and the DH, many children have been vaccinated without their parents being disclosed the critical information about demonstrated risks of serious adverse reactions, one that the JCVI appeared to have been fully aware of. It would also appear that, by withholding this information, the JCVI/DH neglected the right of individuals to make an informed consent concerning vaccination. By doing so, the JCVI/DH may have violated not only International Guidelines for Medical Ethics (i.e., Helsinki Declaration and the International Code of Medical Ethics) [2] but also, their own Code of Practice.  Dr Lucija Tomljenovic continues:  The transcripts of the JCVI meetings also show that some of the Committee members had extensive ties to pharmaceutical companies and that the JCVI frequently co-operated with vaccine manufacturers on strategies aimed at boosting vaccine uptake. Some of the meetings at which such controversial items were discussed were not intended to be publicly available, as the transcripts were only released later, through the Freedom of Information Act (FOI). These particular meetings are denoted in the transcripts as “commercial in confidence”, and reveal a clear and disturbing lack of transparency, as some of the information was removed from the text (i.e., the names of the participants) prior to transcript release under the FOI section at the JCVI website (for example, JCVI CSM/DH (Committee on the Safety of Medicines/Department of Health) Joint Committee on Adverse Reactions Minutes 1986-1992).  http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-vaccine-coverup-30-years-of-secret-official-transcripts-show-uk-government-experts-cover-up-vaccine-hazards-to-sell-more-vaccines-and-harm-your-kids/5354241",0,2016-01-08T03:21:41.000Z,0.0735653235653,0.41202686202699995,en,globalresearch,http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-vaccine-coverup-30-years-of-secret-official-transcripts-show-uk-government-experts-cover-up-vaccine-hazards-to-sell-more-vaccines-and-harm-your-kids/5354241,False,False

Olfactory plasticity and conditioning is quite an interesting area, i read about a few studies where they worked on the conditioning of C.elegans to food odor such as benzaldehyde and saw how they regulated dauer formation and sensed population density. I was wondering if there could be something similar related to fear condition via smells. So far, i've read about auditory fear conditioning and its related mechanisms. That is why i'm interested in the role of smell in conditioning fear.  BTW recently, i read about a article where researchers have found about that the brain is much faster at responding to terrified screams and what sets it apart from normal day to day conversations(not just in frequency or loudness) http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/07/why-screams-are-so-scary?utm_campaign=email-news-latest&utm_src=email  This is the kind of study i want, to see what sets apart the fear ""phermones"" from other phermones, and the difference in the response pattern of our brain. ",0,2015-07-21T09:28:58.000Z,0.10535714285700001,0.45,en,sciencemag,http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/07/why-screams-are-so-scary?utm_campaign=email-news-latest&utm_src=email,False,False

Not saying he has to but if you are going to bring up 1 vegan that looks muscular naturally i can bring up 5 non vegans that look muscular naturally. so what is your point? you found an exception which is always very easy to do. clearly youre not muscular or show any real muscularity neither do lthe rest of the vegan population.  as for not being able to detoxify vitamin A. you clearly believe in evolution and you have no proof that we evolved to be on a plant only diet just as i have no proof that over time cooking our food has made us evolve to be less able to detoxify vitamin A. both cannot be proven at all so please dont bring up evolution again and just shut the fuck up.  also please read and it clearly says ""our enzymes evolved to digest meat"" http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-humans-eat-meat-excerpt/  so theres again how you clearly only research what favors your argument instead of the whole.  now if avi is taking steroids he can eat whatever he wants and gain muscle because thats what steroids do due to their ability to make the user absorb a much higher percentage of the food they eat.  if he hasnt done steroids hes been training for 30+ years itd be pathetic of him to not have at least some gains if hes been training for this long this seriously.  bottom line is youre a sad little bitch thats jealous of other people, your fellow vegans dont even like you, youre trying so hard to prove youre right but your just spinning in a fucking circle. both diets are fine. vegan or not. there are vegans who live to very old age and there are non vegans who also live to very old age.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3131587/World-s-oldest-person-115-eats-four-strips-bacon-morning-likes-wear-fancy-lacy-lingerie.html  shes 115 yrs old and eats 4 strips of bacon a day. explain this you stupid dumb fuck.  ive never commented on anyones shit before i made an account literaly just to say this because youre seriously so fucking stupid i couldnt keep my mouth shut.  also i saw your vid on leroy.  respect your fukking elders dude you deserve to get the fukking shit slapped out of your 160 lbs faggot ass for that shit.  everyone go watch this! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn8Rd3efEqk  nice biceps bro!! is that all you workout? is it arm day everyday? how long it take to get them to 14 inches? you wish you could be like leroy. you train arms everyday dont you, you jealous bitch.",0,2015-08-01T23:05:17.000Z,-0.0196110225058,0.525427457533,en,scientificamerican,http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-humans-eat-meat-excerpt/,True,False

In fact  here's an article which highlights  studies that have those findings. http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/study-urges-moderation-in-red-meat-intake-201203134490  And secondly, trying to use social ethics to Veganism like suggesting that  because it's widely deemed cowardly for men to hit women, that this translates to klling animals for food.....is a  fundamentally  flawed claim line of argument for several reasons.  a.)  While the contexts of violence are debatable, it's widely deemed cowardly for a  ""man   to hit a wonman ""    because the situational model that is often associated  with it is that in  circumstances of abuse it is seen as a desperate exercise of power in search for exerting authority that one does not have..  But this does not necessarily make it true because of social perception as NOT all situations are the same just because it's ""widely perceived"" to be so.   b.)  killing animals for food is seen not as simply an exercise of power, but as acquiring a resource, which has perceived uses for human nourishment. Whether you agree meat is nourishing or not is another story. This is what the intended purpose is.  c.) Ideals about ethics and social behavior are rooted in what is often called ""the Social Contract, In ethics this something that can only be achieved through HUMANS by HUMANS which means animals that we choose to eat for consumption ETHICALLY do not have stake in the social contract and therefore CANNOT apply to them. Even our ideas of Humane treatment of animals is based on the value HUMANS have attributed rather than animals agreeing or disagreeing.   This is why in Western culture we treat dogs as pets and cows as sources of food most of the time. While in some Eastern societies the roles can often be reversed.

The Black Star is expected to cross Earth Orbit Path around May 20, 2016 along the 1.6-million mile segment of space our planet travels on that day in natural movement around the Sun. The inbound Black Star is the reason that the Elite is preparing as we speak to run to their Underground Ark Cities and the reason for all the War Game Exercises like you saw with Jade Helm 15.

Interesting point from the ""Not Always a Cry for Help"" article I linked:  ""(University of Illinois suicide program) has cut the death rate by more than 55%, while the suicide rate at other universities has remained stable over the same time frame. In the seven years before the suicide prevention program was started, there were 16 suicides at the University of Illinois, or 2.3 per year. In the 18 years since, there have been 19 suicides, or 1.05 suicides per year."" ...

I've assumed that in general both would have gone up at some rate.  tl;dr of my post: http://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/06/17/cry-for-help/  and... https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200305/not-always-cry-help  Regarding suicide attempts, I used to be a part of a couple irc groups on suicide and depression back in my teens.  I had my own problems but I was there more to try and help people sort through their own depression as I found my own online experiences had helped me.  Out of the two channels, I don't actually remember there being a user who stated they were a guy, except for myself.  I came to know about a dozen girls well over the course of a few years on there and we talked a bit about their experiences.  Some had tried to commit suicide at one point (many multiple) and were now in therapy while others were just cutting (some being put into therapy for being a risk to themselves).  I also know that a good portion of the channel really didn't want to die, I remember a few girls had phoned up loved ones saying they were about to kill themselves (some after taking meds, most not or not in lethal doses) and recounting stories about it.  I was also part of other channels on irc during those days, of the couple dozen other regulars I talked with daily, I received confirmation years later that three of the guys eventually killed themselves.  I knew them through regular channels regarding games and tech.  One girl I used to know who finally did commit suicide had been trying to over the course of the 3 years I knew her.  She did want to die and had attempted at least a dozen times that I've heard about in detail.  She was in therapy and at one point was living in a psych ward.    I compare that to a guy that I met online through a 4chan baww thread one year.  We hit it off and exchanged information.  I stayed in touch with him for a couple months; great guy we talked a lot about many topics beyond the reasons why he wanted to kill himself.  At the end he told me he already bought the gun he was going to use on his next birthday.  He said that life had gotten better for him recently but he was still going to go through with his original decision.  He was looking forward to it.  He also thanked me for talking with him and trying to help.  Death numbers do reflect what actually happens.  Many women who attempt suicide do want to die, however many do not.  Those who don't, they use methods where if they call for help they still can be.  That's not to say the ones who want to die use different methods, they're just less likely to call out.  Other self-harm coping measures can also be misunderstood as suicide attempts if they're found out.   This doesn't even start to get into the threats I've heard about or seen.  Many over relationships, many of which are meant to control the other person.  So the question I'll leave with: do the suicide attempt numbers record the amount of people who attempt, or just the number of occasions?",0,2015-04-21T09:06:30.000Z,0.18378552971599998,0.425173921686,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200305/not-always-cry-help,False,False

But the changes need not be related to each other at all, and could be related to coding of entirely unrelated segments of the genome. In a population of several thousand, a mere 300 changes is minor, especially when you consider that de novo mutations in humans number around 100 (and that's per generation, WITHIN a family, not across the entire species).  http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/estimating-human-mutation-rate-direct.html   ...And then there's the small matter of the fact that chimps have ALSO been diverging from our common ancestor, so the weight of mutations required, per generation, is now split between chimps and ourselves, which moves your ""0.5 million generations"" to '1 million generations across two species', and your ""300 mutations fixed per generation"", down to 150.  Furthermore, these changes need not have happened evenly, generation by generation. Inter-breeding between previously separated populations and population bottlenecks (caused by such things as the massive climate fluctuations around 1.9 MYA: Shultz & Maslin, 2013) account for the settling and recombination of distinct lines.   Your stepping stone analogy misses a significant point. It is quite possible for an individual to jump to a stepping stone to the left or right of the gap, and then to the three or four on from from that, and then rejoin what appears to be the line made up by the missing stepping stones. I can illustrate this best with my own analogy:  A man was puzzled by his wife's preparation of roast lamb. She always cut off the knuckle before putting the joint in the oven. When asked why, her response was always, 'because that's how you roast lamb.' So he went to her mother, and asked her how to roast lamb... and she, too, would always cut off the knuckle. And likewise with her mother. Finally, the man happened to have an opportunity to speak with his wife's great-grandmother. He asked her how to cook a roast lamb, and she explained that you have to cut off the knuckle. 'Why?', he asked. 'Because if you don't,' she said, 'the joint won't fit in the roasting tray.'  So, you see, a particular behaviour (analogous to a gene, or a stepping stone), was changed (analogous to a mutation or different stepping stone) in response to an environmental constraint (a deviation from the main line of stepping stones). Subsequent behaviour (analogous to a different mutation, or indeed a deletion) by the man, changed the behaviour, but there is no direct link between the wife's inherited behaviour (the genome), and the new behaviour (a mutation which effectively deletes traces of its own past) which takes over from the old behaviour.  In other words, the man's wife now cooks lamb to her mother's recipe, but doesn't cut the knuckle off (presumably the way her great-great-grandmother would have). So, the great-grandmother, the grandmother, and the mother (three generations) now represent three missing stepping stones with regard to a recipe, despite the fact that the act of cutting off the knuckle has appeared and disappeared in the timeline.   Indeed, a number of the differences between ourselves and chimpanzees are due to deletions, which may represent a number of your missing stepping stones (or a number of the deviations from the obvious line): ""These genetic gaps have primarily been caused by the activity of retroviral-like transposable element sequences,"" said McDonald. ""Transposable elements were once considered 'junk DNA' with little or no function. Now it appears that they may be one of the major reasons why we are so different from chimpanzees.""  ...and, as it happens, many of the changes in phenotype between the common ancestor we share with chimps and ourselves has nothing to do with the genome, but with the way in which genes are regulated, rather than changes in sequencing:  ""Our findings are generally consistent with the notion that the morphological and behavioral differences between humans and chimpanzees are predominately due to differences in the regulation of genes rather than to differences in the sequence of the genes themselves.""

It is something that has been a central part of certain cultures for many generations who hold gold and silver as highly valuable that makes me feel it is much greater in value than what we in the west are lead to believe. As far as India not knowing what they are doing, how much gold you think was stolen from India during British rule? If it had no value, why was it taken? It made England wealthy. There was a recent article, ""Petrodollar Panic? China Signs Currency Swap Deal With Qatar and Canada"". http://www.globalresearch.ca/petrodollar-panic-china-signs-currency-swap-deal-with-qatar-and-canada/5413467 Do you feel the Canadian government is concerned about Canada's economic welfare and where it is headed and feel that China is the next big economic powerhouse within the next decade Canada must build a relationship with them in order to grow?

Unfortunately, your idealism interferes. Life isn't fair. Injustices do exist, and if you spend all your time trying to extinguish them, you'll waste all your life. I'm not a fan of injustices myself, and I suppose we've all felt them at one time or another. But it's not the governments job to make sure your life is fair. Aside from natural, God-given rights, humans are created very differently. That's not a problem, and the fact that not everyone is treated the same way by fate shouldn't be either. Charity has its place, but sound advice from long ago still stands: A friend to all is a friend to none. A government that tries to make everyone equal only makes everyone suffer. Equality of outcome is to be shunned, because only in trudging through hardship and working hard will one find success, and you may have to do it more than once to get what you deserve. But ah, the reward to those that do. Not everyone is driven the same way, and so, accordingly, not everyone should be rewarded the same way.   In regards to your thoughts on speech, well, again, I think your idealism is getting the better of you. The truth hurts. I said it before and I'll say it again. People don't like to hear things that make them uncomfortable, that speak right to their soul about their own shortcomings. Too many people depend on others, chiefly the government and authority figures, to do things for them. But I digress, let's look at who should be shunned (yet are not) by most, or the larger voice at least, of society for saying things that are lies or varying degrees of evil (or both): Black Lives Matter, feminists, Planned Parenthood and their affiliates, the (largely leftist) media, the education system, colleges specifically. I could go on but I think you get the point. Odd how all these factions get praise and defense from most mainstream media, while doing little to no actual good. Society's judgement is pretty awful if you ask me.  I have proof against Global Warming: First and foremost, the world has already been flooded, and the Big Guy who did it promised He wouldn't flood the Earth again -> Genesis 9:11 ""I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth.""   But I'm sensing that won't be enough to convince you, so let me take an approach more your style: Here's an article from Nat Geo, which will pro-GW, still admits that the world is not rapidly growing hotter ---> http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/04/130401-global-warming-antarctica-sea-ice-science-environment/  Here's an entire site that is anti-GW ---> http://www.aproundtable.org/tps30info/globalwarmup.html  But if all that is still not enough, use common sense: If man can hardly predict the weather for the next two weeks without some flaw, why ever would you trust him to tell you about the next several years of weather?   More talk of injustice, eh? Let me quote Mr. Aristotle again: A friend to all is a friend to none. You cannot destroy all the injustice in the world, it is simply beyond your power. Look after that which is reasonable, ie, your own brothers under American law. But be cautious. Illegal aliens may be ""qualified"" to become citizens, but that does not mean it would be in anyone's benefit but their own to become citizens.   You say there is no superior race, and yet the liberals of our day certainly seem to think that any race that isn't white is the best. That's just a bit of a contradiction, don't you think? ""Man is man"", is it? Not according to those feminists, man is evil in their eyes! And goodness, I wonder where the LGBT movement stands on the statement ""man is man""....just something to think about. ",0,2016-02-17T05:53:13.000Z,0.062152777777800004,0.4889496152,en,nationalgeographic,http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/04/130401-global-warming-antarctica-sea-ice-science-environment/,False,False

The INQUA ( International Union for Quaternary Research Commission on Sea Level Changes and Coastal Evolution's  official position on climate change, which opens by saying (emphasis added):  ""Climate change is real There is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and, indirectly, from increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes in many physical and biological systems. It is very likely that most of the observed increase in global temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is due to human-induced increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere (IPCC 2007).

(Seccombe, 2012). B.    The rate of divorce in the United States is among the highest in the world, and a large number of children are affected. (Seccombe, 2012). How are the effects of divorce impacting children and our society?  D.    Effects of divorce on children and society.   1. The positives and negatives  2. Is divorce to blame or are the situations surrounding the divorce the problem?   3. What can be done to lessen the impact?  E. We will discuss all of these important topics.  II.   The effects of divorce on children- the positives and the negatives. (90 seconds) A. Some of the negative aspects of divorce for children can be parental conflict, the loss of a parent, a reduced standard of living and psychological impact. (Seccombe, 2012; Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2001). 1. Parents may use their children as a weapon to hurt their ex-spouse, they may also ask their children to choose sides or use them as a way to find out information on the other parent. (Seccombe, 2012). These are all very negative and harmful behaviors that potentially have lasting effects on the children.  2. Children typically live with their mothers after a divorce and while this is not necessarily a bad thing, children may feel the loss of their father very deeply. Fathers who have sporadic and irregular visits with their children tend to have children with the most negative impacts of divorce. (Seccombe, 2012).  3. Men typically have a higher earning potential than women and because of this and the fact that it is more common for women to get physical custody of the children this can have a huge impact on the standard of living for children of divorce. (Seccombe, 2012; Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2001).  Divorce also leads to duplication of raw materials, such as televisions, toys, and kitchen necessities. This is a prime example of overuse. (Boyle, 2000). 4. Psychological effects on children of divorce include aggressive, impulsive and antisocial behaviors. They also have deterioration in academic performance. (Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2001). Children of divorced parents are more likely to have stress related illnesses and get divorced themselves. (Boyle, 2000).  5. Children from divorced parents tend to have a higher chance of divorcing in adulthood and they have a harder time forming and maintaining intimate relationships. (Arkowitz & Lillenfeld, 2013) This tends to impact our social sustainability. The definition of social sustainability is the ability of a community to develop processes and structures which not only meet the needs of its current members but also support the ability of future generations to maintain a healthy community. (Social sustainability, n.d.). B.    Positive aspects include reducing exposure to parental conflict, happier parents and positive models.   1. If conflict in the home is extensive research has shown that divorce can actually have a positive impact on children. (Seccombe, 2012) 2. According to Bennett if parents are happier, so are their children (2012) 3. When parent model that they deserve to be in a healthy satisfying relationship they teach their children not to settle for an unhealthy marriage. (Bennett 2012).  III. Is divorce to blame or are the situations surrounding the divorce? (90 seconds) A. According to the Journal of American Board of Family Medicine, nearly half of the behavioral, academic and achievement problems of boys were seen 4 years before the parents separated. (2001). This, leads us to believe that it may not be the process of divorce that causes children the negative impact but the amount of discord between parents.  B.    If good parenting with consistent, middle-of-road discipline is used the impact on children is greatly improved. (Arkowitz & Lillenfeld, 2013). C.    Bennett states, ""What's most important to remember is your newfound single life after divorce is what you make it -- and your children's attitude and well-being will follow suit.” (2012). IV. What can be done to lessen the impact on children and our society?  (90 seconds) A.    Limit the conflict associated with the divorce process or limit the child’s exposure to it. (Arkowitz & Lillenfeld, 2013).  B.    Provide good parenting and have at least one well-functioning parent. (Arkowitz & Lillenfeld, 2013). C. The big question remains what can be done to improve the outcomes for our children? How can we teach and encourage them to have lasting relationships that nurture healthy communities?   V.    Conclusion (45 seconds) A.    With all of this information it is important to take into consideration each aspect before a decision is made to divorce or to stay married for the sake of the children.  B.    We have reviewed the positive and negative impact of divorce on children, if the divorce itself is necessarily to blame or the conditions surrounding the divorce and what can be done to lessen the impact on children our society. C.    In the end is isn’t about if divorce is right or wrong; it’s about minimizing the impact.     References  Arkowitz,H. & Lilienfeld,S.O. (2013, Feburary 14). Is divorce bad for children.

How can we teach and encourage them to have lasting relationships that nurture healthy communities?   V.    Conclusion (45 seconds) A.    With all of this information it is important to take into consideration each aspect before a decision is made to divorce or to stay married for the sake of the children.  B.    We have reviewed the positive and negative impact of divorce on children, if the divorce itself is necessarily to blame or the conditions surrounding the divorce and what can be done to lessen the impact on children our society. C.    In the end is isn’t about if divorce is right or wrong; it’s about minimizing the impact.     References  Arkowitz,H. & Lilienfeld,S.O. (2013, Feburary 14). Is divorce bad for children.

It may not even be a risk to someone who eats it regularly as there isn't conclusive evidence that shows a definite risk for consumers. But factory workers may be at risk because of microwave popcorn and so if that's the case, I'm not sure it's worth it. I personally do not buy it for this reason. Here is some info on the whole salmon thing to give a more balanced perspective: http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/update0404b.shtml. Here's also something actually balanced about potato chips: http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/11/19/246188051/remember-death-by-french-fries-here-s-the-story . I doubt there is really any risk from potato chips because there has been no link in research found between dietary acrylamide and various types of cancers. Eating potato chips is probably much more problematic for other things than this substance and I wouldn't be surprised at all if the amount of arcylamde, naturally found in foods, posed virtually no threat. Parabens have weak estrogenic properties and there has been no definitive link between cancer and the substance. Parabens are hundreds to thousands of time weaker than natural estrogens so it is very likely not a risk factor for cancer. I want the crap researched out of them, just to be sure, but so far I find no reason to ditch the substance and I have researched the heck out of this topic and what has been found and said by scientists.

How's that for a study on how porn supposedly shrinks the brain? This matter regarding porn as the cause is far, far from definitive. Here are some quotes from the researcher:  _Our findings indicated that grey matter volume of the right caudate of the striatum is smaller with higher pornography use,"" the researchers said._  [""higher pornography use"" is the key phrase here.]  _But were men with smaller striatums seeking more porn, or did more porn make the brain smaller? Was it a consequence, or a precondition?_  _Individuals with lower striatum volume may need more external stimulation to experience pleasure and might therefore experience pornography consumption as more rewarding, which may in turn lead to more porn watching, said the authors, concluding that more study is needed._  http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/may/29/porn-viewing-linked-less-grey-matter-brain  Something to also remember about studies is the conclusions made by them are often proven false at a later time.

In the body we have lots of bacteria, some which are good for us and others that may cause illnesses such as the common cold. The body's immune system (like an anti-virus on a computer), works around the clock to defend itself against any bacteria that may attack healthy cells. In general the bacteria that causes a yeast infection can be present in most healthy humans.   The short answer is that sometimes the immune system breaks down causing for example rashes on the skin to appear, crustiness of nails, and potential leakage of fluids from genitalia, that is neither urine, semen, or blood.

A Korean population is more closely related (based on genetic clustering and allele frequencies) to a Mongolian population than they are to a Yoruba population. Likewise, a Yoruba population will have more genetic similarity with a Nilotic Mandinka population than it will with a Tungusic population. There are subspecies of Plains Zebra that you likely couldn't tell apart by the eye, which also have less genetic variation between their fellow subspecies than Human groups have between themselves, yet they are still considered distinct. The only real reason that remains as to why we do not separate geographical populations into separate subspecies is that they are now less isolated due to rapid population growth within the past century or two and advances in transportation technology. A Sub Saharan African knows well that he is different from a European or an East Asian. The different races acknowledge that they are different, themselves, and correctly so, as presented in this study where scientists were able to accurately identify the self ascribed race of participants with almost 100% accuracy based only on a sample of their genome. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196372/ Then you'd have to take into account the archaic introgression of different hominids within separate populations and the implications that come from it.

All supposed images of satellites in orbit show fake CGI “satellites” orbiting a fake CGI “ball-Earth.” First conceived by Freemason science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke in 1945, they claim satellites became science-fact soon after. This is impossible for many reasons, including the fact the melting points of the metals used in satellites are far lower than the temperature in the “thermosphere” where satellites supposedly are. Satellites, space stations, the Hubble telescope and space travel in general are absolutely the biggest hoaxes of the century, and NASA the most successful propaganda organization in history  For thousands of years the “planets” were known as “wandering stars” as they differ from the fixed stars in their relative motions only. Through a telescope both the fixed stars and wandering “planets” appear as nothing more than tiny round dots of light, luminaries, circling the night sky. They do NOT appear in any way to be spherical Earth-like terra firma capable of landing on as the Freemasons at NASA would have us believe with their fake CGI pictures and videos. Earth is in fact a plane and “planets” do not exist! They just added a “T” and you fell for it.Watch NASA’s fake CGI spinning ball-Earth compared with actual amateur balloon footage from space, showing the Earth to be completely flat and motionless, and NASA to be the most successful liars in history.

Sternberg was never an employee of the Smithsonian: his term as a research associate always had a limited duration, and when it ended he was offered a new position as a research collaborator. As editor, Sternberg's decision to ""peer-review"" and approve Meyer's paper by himself was highly questionable on several grounds, which was why the scientific society that published the journal later repudiated it. Sternberg had always been planning to step down as the journal's editor—the issue in which he published the paper was already scheduled to be his last.  The report prepared by Rep.

You most likely also have aunts, uncles and cousins. They are NOT your ancestors, but they are your family. Genetic testing would no doubt bear out those relationships. The three billion base pairs of your DNA is your genome and it is 99.9% identical to that of every other human on earth. In a larger sense, that is also your family. We have recently been able to decode Neanderthal DNA and find their DNA is 99.5% identical to ours. They are not our ancestors, but they are family. Chimpanzees share 98.5% of our DNA. They are NOT our ancestors, but they are FAMILY.   Yet that 98.5% of shared human-chimp DNA is far from the strongest evidence for common ancestry. There are also *Pseudo-genes*, thousands of them. They are found within the genomes of most, if not all species; genes that no longer produce the protein specified by their original sequence due to disabling mutations (i.e. premature stop codon or frame shift). They are like the stuff in our attics, no longer useful but not yet discarded. Since we are talking about a mutation in a single gene of a genome of perhaps 3 billion base pairs , two species having the same pseudo-gene, disabled by the same mutation, the most likely explanation is that they were acquired from a common ancestor. There are multiple such pseudo-genes shared between related species. One might argue that a single pseudo-gene in common between species could possibly be coincidence, but the existence of hundreds of shared pseudo-genes lies way outside the range of coincidence possibilities and is about as certain evidence for common ancestry exists in science. Remember that in science, NOTHING is EVER considered ""proven"". Every determination made by science is PROVISIONAL in that it can be changed IF AND WHEN evidence dictates. Science is a search for truth, and that search never ends. However, each and every pseudo gene shared by multiple species and disabled by the same mutation is an independent piece of evidence for common ancestry. Every piece of evidence adds to the certainty that the theory is correct.   The mere fact that the genomes of virtually every species contain these pseudo-genes is perfectly consistent with common descent and evolutionary theory. They do not support 'intelligent design' as it cannot explain why they are there at all. Nor can so called 'ID' account for the fact that those species previously established as related by DNA analysis also have the same pseudo genes disabled by identical mutations. The most plausible explanation for multiple species having the same pseudo-gene disabled by identical mutations is Common Ancestry.   There are within the human genome, more than 13,000 pseudo-genes ; comparable to the number of protein-coding genes. Many of them were olfactory genes that once coded for a protein sensitive to a limited range of chemical signatures. Creationism has no explanation for why those genes should remain in the human genome, but they make perfect sense in light of the Theory of Evolution. What is more, our ape relatives have many of the same pseudo-genes, disabled by the same mutations. Not 'similar' mutations, but the exact same mutations as would be expected from common ancestry. Again, no explanation from creationists, but fully explained by descent from a common ancestor.   Another example is that humans and our closest primate relatives, i.e. apes, monkeys and tarsiers, all have inherited a mutation that makes it impossible to synthesize our own vitamin C. One gene in the production of vitamin C (GULO) was destroyed, probably by a virus which is still embedded in the gene. This is a negative mutation, but as long as we get enough of it in our diets, we're OK. When we don't, we get scurvy. The mutation that disabled the gene is the same as the one disabling that gene in all primates of the suborder Haplorrhini. Again, evidence of common ancestry. Most other mammals are able to metabolize their own vitamin C as their GULO genes are intact. The Indian fruit bat and the guinea pig also cannot make their own vitamin C, but their genes for it are broken in different places. Those events happened independently of the loss in the haplorrhini suborder of primates, which includes Tarsiers, New World Monkeys, Old World Monkeys, and apes, including humans. It does not include Lemurs and Lorises (suborder Strepsirrhini). What that means is that this gene was disabled far back in the course of primate evolution about 50 mya at the time of divergence and passed to each subsequent generation. It indicates that ALL Haplorrhini had a common ancestor, most likely the extinct omomyids, which are considered to be the most basal haplorhines. For more information, see: Vitamin C And Common Ancestry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF2N2lbb3dk  There are a great many other pseudo-genes, some of which have active components, despite the inability to code for a protein. Most human pseudo-genes are shared with out closest relatives.   Adding to the certainty we get from examining Pseudo-genes is the evidence from *Endogenous Retroviruses (ERV's)*. Science has revealed the presence of thousands of ERV's; the 'fossil' remnants of ancestral viral infections that become trapped in the genomes of most if not all mammals and passed to successive generations. These viral sequences comprise 8% of the human genome, each and every one of them the genetic fossil of different ancestral retroviral infection. When these viruses enter a cell, they insert a DNA copy of their RNA into the host genome at a RANDOM location. As each cell replicates, the DNA is copied with the viral insert AT THAT SAME LOCATION. Somatic (body) cells with such inserts do not survive the host individual but viral DNA inserted into the genomes of sperm or egg cells do have the potential of being passed to future generations, again AT THE SITE OF THE ORIGINAL INSERTION. The presence of a particular ERV at the same site in the genomes of multiple species is prima facie evidence of common ancestry. Each and every shared ERV is an additional piece of evidence in support of common ancestry. Creationists are at a loss to explain ERV's as they are inconsistent with their world view. They are however perfectly explanatory by evolutionary theory.  Read Carl Zimmer's The Sixty-Million-Year Virus  http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2006/03/13/the-sixty-million-year-virus/ also https://kriskodisko.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/endogenous-retroviruses-and-homologous-pseudogenes/   https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/viro/research/working-groups/retroviral-persistence-in-humans/human-endogenous-retroviruses/research-topics/index.html   Science is by nature skeptical. It is never persuaded by single pieces of evidence. It remains skeptical if a proposition is supported by a single line of evidence. In the case of evolution and specifically Common Descent, multiple lines of evidence are called into play. Exogenous Retroviruses are not a single line of evidence, each and every single ERV is its own line of evidence as each represents a different ancestral viral infection. Likewise, each and every pseudo-gene is a separate line of evidence. In addition, Protein Redundancy constitutes still another line of evidence. Even before we had the decoded genomes for comparison, it had been determined that chimp and human proteins were 98% identical.",1,2017-09-15T18:57:16.000Z,0.0448725348725,0.44003367003399996,en,nationalgeographic,http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2006/03/13/the-sixty-million-year-virus/,False,False

This does not prove evolution.* It's the observable fact that the generic material in life change over generations, that traits is demonstrably inheritable and the fact that our genetics control our traits that causes drives evolution.  Look, evolution is not a claim, it's an observation.   *Name one specie that came into existence in the last 200 years.* First of all, evolution is not mutual to speciation. You don't need to demonstrate speciation to be able to demonstrate evolution.  Anyhow, here is a few sources describing observed instances of speciation. Many of them is published scientific papers that is easily found using Google. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/100201_speciation https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/evolution-watching-speciation-occur-observations/ http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-speciation.html  *can name hundreds that have been extinct.* Me to. But it's irrelevant to the question.   *We were created and as time passes the less creatures we have.  If it weren't for specie preservation all over the world many more species would be extinct.  Evolution hasn't created anything and it still isn't creating new species.* ALL evidence we have of former life show that life has evolved from simpler states. There is NO, evidence for any form of creation. The fact that you start by shit talking evolution instead of providing evidence FOR your claim is quite an good example of this. You have no such things so therefore you must attack what stand against you.   As demonstrated above, speciation occur. I guess this is where you just will drop that claim, ignoring what speciation is (if you actually knew that in the first place) and start chanting about ""kinds"" or the fact that ""Bacteria is just bacteria!!""? :D   *We all have a different DNA and putting two together, a new one is formed.  That's not evolution.  Apple trees give off apples, not oranges.  Dogs give birth to dogs, not pigs.* Again, evolution is a change in the gene frequency in life over generations. As the gene frequency change life WILL change with it. You trying to make up your own definitions or not understanding long term effects of a process is not an argument against the subject, it's just an example of your ignorance or dishonesty.  *PUT 50 MILLION MONKEYS TOGETHER AND WE NEVER GET HUMANS!!!* That is true. Not because evolution don't exist but because humanity is no goal for evolution.   I'm not sure if you are trolling or if you just are very ignorant. The last one is at least curable. It's 2017 and you live in the information age. You literally have most of the human knowledge in front of your finger tips. What you have demonstrated here so far is a hugely incorrect image of what evolution is. You have also made a lot of claims that you haven't bothered to backup with any form of source. Where do you think you will get by doing so?

Since it was closer in time, it has more documentation of external sources of how it derived from Christianity. I then looked at Christianity as the same thing occurring from Judaism.  In the Modern age we have political reform to push forward change for the benefit of the majority. Back then, you started a ""righteous movement"" according to god's will (perfect example is ISIS). However I was impeded because I found:   2 Esdras 6:48  So for along time, Protestant churches were to blame for the lack of Christians not knowing of such literature originally being in their scripture describing evolution.  Things finally fell through however when the nail in the coffin came to the fact that humanity originated from a gene pool of 10,000 to 15,000 people. Hardly a bottleneck and since I've taken evolution in college that caught my attention. Not being the story of two individuals (i.e. Adam and Eve). I put down my Bible as historical literature just as much as the Torah or books on say Zeus, ect.  Where I stand now if I had to pick a theistic view would be Igtheism (i.e. a form of Ignosticism).

I'm still convinced that if we bred dogs for a thousand years that we would still have dogs at the end.  I know that's not scientific enough for someone who goes by Mr., but maybe  your still have some explaining to do on this ridiculous leap you claim to have figured out. --I have searched.  Still looking for something impressive.   --Willfully looking for an example of cross species migration that I can observe.   --You are obviously parroting the anti-creationists websites.  Are you a dummy?  You probably never even heard of Dr William Lane Craig or Dr. Berlinski.   --Note to self.  Mrmexmerized believes I am stupid for questioning his unproven theory.  He may be hiding something.  (vague accusation). --Have a great weekend.  I mean it.",0,2016-09-02T22:23:38.000Z,-0.0780185185185,0.453473544974,en,nationalgeographic,http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150910-human-evolution-change/,False,False

That includes raqia, the vault, 2nd heaven. But in 1:2 the vault does not exist yet, so clearly no continuation. Instead 1:2 and onwards _describe_ that creation.  It becomes more obvious with the true translation of Genesis 1:1. The context of the verb ""bara"" (to create) is ""to (trans)form  / shape"". It is otherwise only used for the forming of Adam from dust. The verb has similar meanings in Phoenician, Assyrian and Sabean. Also, ""ha-ares"" does not mean ""the Earth"". It means ""the land / nation / earth (soil - ground)"".  So Genesis 1:1 says *the land* and the heavens were created. And Genesis 1:6 explains how: The vault was formed and raised, and then dry land appeared.  But even if you don't accept this translation straight from Hebrew, and surely you won't, it is very dodgy apologetics to place Genesis 2:4 after Genesis 1. There is no indication anywhere Adam wasn't the first, and 2:4 in fact explicitly states twice that Adam's shaping happened _during_ creation, by the words ""when"" and ""in the day"".  Adam literally means ""red"" and Adama ""dust / dry earth / soil"". This matches very nicely with how Adam was made. From soil (apparently iron rich). Now why would they use this in Genesis 1 for both mankind and Adam, if no connection was intended? It makes no sense.  Jeremiah 4:23-25?? Shame on you for buying into such laughably fraudulent apologetics bullshit. Blatantly ripped out of context. Jeremiah 4 is a warning to Israel and Judah, which of course did not exist yet in 4000 BC. If the Israelites and Judeans did not return to a pissed off Yahweh, invaders would turn the land into a depopulated waste. The heavens going dark is just a nice touch of drama and symbolism, because Yahweh's light would not shine on those nations anymore. That's stuff referring to an impending war in the 1st millennium BC. Perhaps the same as in Isaiah 1-7 but I didn't bother going that deep.  ""Genesis 1:28"" -- I know it says so in at least one of about 20 English bible versions, but there is no ""replenish"" translation with either NAS, NASB or Brown-Driver-Biggs. http://biblehub.com/hebrew/4390.htm And nowhere in Genesis 1 is there any mention of all that had just been created, being destroyed first.  How am I supposed to imagine this anyway? So those supposedly existing first ""adam(s)"" were not created from dust, in the elohim's image?  ""Universe today .com"""" -- Well either you misunderstood or the author (Fraser Cain?) was simply wrong. Göbleki Tepe clearly shows an advanced civilisation 9,500 BC. I could not find your specific article, but elsewhere I found this: http://www.nature.com/news/anthropocene-the-human-age-1.17085 Not the chapter Interactive: Landscape architecture.  “(assumed) mutation rates"" -- They are not ""assumed"", they are extrapolated from known mutation rates and the can be calibrated by checking genomes of corpses, fossils. And just like DNA from living humans, the location it comes from matters a great deal. That's why I said migration patterns can be established / confirmed by these studies. It places the cradle of mankind in CE-Africa and that all fits together quite nicely with evidence of archaeology and paleontology.   ""an ""Eve"" ancestral to all members of genus Homo."" -- Really? I find that extremely unlikely, since the supposed ancestor to the genus Homo, Australopithecus, went extinct some 2.9 million years ago. Our closest ancestor would be Homo Heidelbergensis.  Chimps are not classified within the Genus Homo but right next to it, so I don't know what you're getting at.  ""It doesn't mean it that didn't either!"" -- . True, but apart from being pure speculation based on nothing, it's wishful thinking based on ignorance.  With pure inbreeding, there would be no genetic diversity. Which we do have. We'd all be virtually identical. Which we're not. Well, except for the massive amounts of genetic defects, resulting in excessively high morbidity and (infant) mortality rates. Which we do not have. This too debunks a global flood. Watch ""The Noah's Ark and the Cheetah"".  ""It was the scientific community that named them mtEve and Y-Adam."" -- Yeah it has a nice ring, but I don't think they foresaw that it would lead to misconception and abuse among creationists.  ""Evidence suggest a population bottle neck, the human race was almost wiped out"" -- The only bottleneck mankind experienced was during the exit out of Africa some 55,000 years ago.  There most definitily was no bottleneck anywhere around 2350 BC. There is no such evidence anywhere in archaeological finds, nor in ancient historical documentation, so who told you that?  In fact, with a global flood we would probably find virtually nothing of use from prior to 2350 BC. So I most certainly hope you're thinking of a small populace that stil stuck closely to Mesopotamia, where there was a huge river flood around 2900 BC, which historians think served as a basis for all Near & Middle East flood myths later on.  ""This would explain Y-Adam, actually Noah, coming after Eve!"" -- Well, apart from the fact that you blatantly ignore everything indicating this is massive shoehorning of science into the flood myth, you forget that Noah would have had the exact same genetic markers as Adam, silly. And you're hopelessly inconsistent. Then why is Noah's wife not mtEve? Come on man... think...  ""The only difference are the dates which are no doubt colored by evolutionary assumptions."" -- If you;re just going to ignore / dismiss everything I am trying to teach you, then I might as well stop wasting my time.  It's pure projection. Everything I said is evidence based on science you clearly lack quite a lot of knowledge of, and it is interconnected with archaeology and paleontology, which you choose to ignore. All your dating assumptions are based on literally nothing but a very strong religious confirmation bias.  And I suppose I can by now call you a typical intellectually dishonest coward,  since I have asked you three times where your credulity ends on the shared ancestry of species and you simply refuse to play ball.",0,2016-08-30T01:21:14.000Z,0.0924298206937,0.48853713501900004,en,nature_news,http://www.nature.com/news/anthropocene-the-human-age-1.17085,False,False

There can still be quite a lot of variety with those.  Don't believe me? Study the fossils. Take trilobytes, take carnivorans, take horses. I'm quite sure you never bothered studying any fossil lineage because you are satisfied by finding quotes that suit you. Once again, quotes are not evidence.  ""They shoot down their own argument by admitting 'They found that no intermediate forms of fossils exist.” -- I have no idea why the editor (not the scientist Bokma!) wrote that, because it's simply not true. Which you, once again, would have known had you studied evidence, instead of favorable quotes.  Example: particularly the past few decades, ""hundreds if not thousands"" of feathered dino fossils have been found. They are categorised in 43 different species (Listed on Wikipedia), ranging from those with feathered arms, all the way to full wings, and also from rudimentary feathers to more advanced. Add to that 6 different species of Archaeopteryx and a number of early bird species, with varying number of claws. Oh, several dino species also reduction of fingers. There is still a bird species today with claws. And then there are the giant Terror Birds showing up some 63 Mya, which at first glance you might mistake for dino's. No transitionals indeed...  It also tells me you haven't watched the video, or you suffer from selective amnesia, since Coyne listed a number of transitionals.  “How convenient that mass extinction events and other things would wipe out the evidence for gradualism like that."" -- You can scoff all you want, but the fact remains you have no scientific alternative.  And you misunderstood. Those mass extinction events upset ecosystems, upset natural balance (food chain etc). In stable phases, there's relatively little evolution. Few triggers. But in those phases there are plenty. You just don't get to see much of it with the relatively low numbers.  And you have to know where to look. That's why so many feathered dino's and early birds have been found in the past decades.  And again scoff all you want, but you know damned well that the planet's strata are mostly inaccessible, if only for the fact that 2/3 of the planet's surface is ocean. And what percentage of the Ediacaran and early Cambrian rock worldwide do you think we can access hm? How about... virtually nothing?  ""How is then that they can construct the geologic column they say represents the last 600 million years of life on earth?"" -- How about drilling, Sparky? But that won't get you any fossils.  ""Found fossilized by the millions"" -- Can you at least try to be serious? We're not talking all jellyfish / plants over 500 million years, but a specific time frame of about 10 million years.  In 2007 a jellyfish fossil was found that pusjed back their existence from 300 Mya to 505 Mya. That's ONE SINGLE fossil in a period of 205 million years. Still want to tell me it's easy to find soft-bodied animals from that long ago?? http://www.livescience.com/1971-oldest-jellyfish-fossils.html  “ because the explosion happened at the base"" -- Yes, that's what I said: 10 million years. The entire Cambrian Explosion lasted ~80 million years.  ""Common ancestry is not backed up by evidence, living organism appear abruptly fully formed and unrelated."" -- It is backed by plenty of evidence. But since you are exclusively focused on favorable quotes and phases where there is indeed little to no evidence, you have no oversight and no knowledge of the evidence that _does_ exist where you're not looking. Remember what I said about confirmation bias?  Simple fact is that we know for a fact life evolves fitness, complexity and diversity. This has been observed in mere decades.  Another simple fact is that in oversight, the fossil record shows a progression from single celled organisms to ever more advanced. And not in the biblical order, nor so neatly sectioned in days (or periods), I might add.  Third simple fact is that we can use genome comparison to determine how closely related humans are (paternity tests, forensics) are and even, based on geolocation of specific genetic markers, track migration of our ancestors all the way back to Africa some 250,000 years ago. Which corroborates the fossil record on Homo Sapiens. And logically, the exact same principle holds true for inter-species comparison.  Scientists have 1> a fossil record going from simple to complex 2> observable advancement and increase of diversity, 3> explanations of how that happens. 4> ways to determine relatedness and place it in a time frame. 5> evolutionary computer models  And then there's creationists... with unsubstantiated and unfalsifiable faith in a god having magically created groups of lifeforms. Sorry but my money is not on you.  Funny how you, just like almost every other creationist I asked, refused to tell me where the edges of your credulity on shared ancestry lie. Are all canines related? All felines? How about both together? They're anatomically not so different. How about all birds?? Well?? Come on, tell me. Or is that too much heresy?﻿",1,2016-08-27T22:40:46.000Z,0.043283146592,0.44927054155,en,livescience,http://www.livescience.com/1971-oldest-jellyfish-fossils.html,False,False

Back 3000 years ago they did not have even a microscope (did not need one), but they had Jehovah's direct instructions on how to preserve life.   Are Humans Getting Better? What is Really Going On? by James Arjuna  There is ONLY degeneration shown in ALL HUMAN studies of DNA.  There are well over 10,000,000 peer reviewed papers from all over the world clearly showing that humans are degraded, have never ""evolved"" and at the present rate of the rise of genetic defects our species will be reduced to stupid short living animals with no technology, no speech, no intelligence. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=Human+Genetic+Diseases  There are NO beneficial mutations ever found in DNA evidence. http://evolutionsciencenow.blogspot.com/2013/06/evolutions-beneficial-mutations.html  Try this search term and see if you can find any beneficial mutations.  I have spent thousands of hours on that and so far not one beneficial mutation has ever been shown to exist. This search of all the data bases in the world sums up with over 2,000,000 articles and NO beneficial mutations. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Human+Mutations  In all these peer Science studies we find some estimated 20,000 pseudo genes. Pseudo genes are genes that used to code for human cells.  Now they are dead and fading away. Some of them are barely perceivable because of this fading of this coding.   They have completely mapped and studied 14000 of them so far.  http://www.pseudogene.org/human/index.php   http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/9/R51  According to this study we have lost close to 45% of our coding that made us much stronger and much more healthy, fit and much more intelligent.   For those who do not understand math:   Original number of coding genes approximately 45,000;  Coding genes we have now approximately 25,000.  Number of pseudo genes (dead genes) no longer coding for body parts 20,000.   20,000 + 25,000 = 45,000 original genes. 45,000 x 45% = 20250 lost genes.  Actual precise number is 20,000/45,000 = .444444  or 44.4%.  Dr. Gerald Crabtree a renowned geneticists and professor of genetics at Stanford University states that “I would wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions, with a good memory, a broad range of ideas, and a clear-sighted view of important issues. Furthermore, I would guess that he or she would be among the most emotionally stable of our friends and colleagues. I would also make this wager for the ancient inhabitants of Africa, Asia, India or the Americas, of perhaps 2000–6000 years ago. The basis for my wager comes from new developments in genetics, anthropology, and neurobiology that make a clear prediction that our intellectual and emotional abilities are genetically surprisingly fragile.” http://rt.com/usa/intelligence-stanford-years-fragile-531/  http://naturalsociety.com/leading-geneticist-human-intelligence-slowly-declining/  We have lost;  -Brain Size, and skull size -Jaw Size and lost teeth, the 'wisdom"" teeth are remnants of a better stronger larger jaw. -Our larger canine teeth that allowed us to eat more foods. -enzymes in the appendix that gave us the ability to digest harsh fibrous vegetation and get nutrients out of it. -visual acuity. -visual spectrum and color (there are a very few people left with tetrachromatic vision) -night vision. -Our retinas are misshaped and we have blind spots we have to overcome by brain adjustments and glasses.

There’s more about this on the birth defects article. -we cannot produce Vitamin C and many enzymes used to process foods. -eye protective membrane gone “nictitating membrane” - Along with lost hair we see remnants of ‘goose bumps” which are used to raise hair to increase insulation.  You see this in animals when it is cold the hair “fluffs up”   Going away fading out:  -A muscle that show varying degrees of reduction ;Occipitalis Minor -The palmaris longus muscle  appears gone in about 15%-17% of humans going away. -The pyramidalis muscle of the abdomen gone in 20% of humans -in the leg, The plantaris muscle abscent in about 10% of humans -Extra nipples or breasts appear rarely in the population - the existing sense of smell organs degraded in most and we find remnants of superior sense of smell in native South Americans, native North Americans, and African peoples who can identify other by smell; lost ability to sense predators or food and water. -human immune system weakened and undirected causing all sorts of problems and the need for artificial means of survival, vaccines, and antibiotics were not needed for 200,000 years, now we can’t live without them.  There is no indication at all of any improvements. All the nonsense about how ""refined and improved"" we are in utter fantasy.   What are we going to lose next?  This is why the medical industry is stating that modern humans, particularly white Anglo Saxons, white European descent cannot live past 30 years in the wild without technology and medical aid. Keep in mind for 200,000 years (by the assumptive dating methods that have never been proven as correct) humans survived, bred and raised children without any medical at all. And there is no way for use to determine how old someone from the past was. Even 5000 years ago, a 100 year old person could appear to be like a modern 40 year old because we are that much more degraded.   In Human DNA studies we have over 100,000 deleterious mutation found so far and no sign of any beneficial mutation have ever been verified other than by speculation from people who believe we evolved and got better at some point in time in the past where human science was ""different"" than now.   This is the “magical time” of the past where humans supposedly evolved.  There is no physical evidence of this anywhere on the planet. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=Human+Genetic+Diseases  There have been found over 98000 ERV's (endogenous retrovirus). These represent infections a the germ line level.  Infections at the germ line level cause fetal permanent deleterious mutations.  The path of our genetic degradation is mapped clearly in these ERVs which are found in DNA coding for diseases tissues and gene losses, atavism. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521986/      http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002240  Sung Chun1, Justin C. Fay1,2* 1 Computational and Systems Biology Program, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America, 2 Department of Genetics and Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America: ""Evidence for Hitchhiking of Deleterious Mutations within the Human Genome"" According to this article of 1000 samples of human genomes, there is an average of 1000 deleterious mutations per person. Quote: ""Each human is estimated to carry on the order of 1,000 deleterious mutations in their genome."" These are FIXED (permanent) in the reproductive process.  The governments do not want anyone to be concerned and want you to believe that ""big brother and science"" Is taking good care of us and don't worry about 200% rise in babies with brain/spinal tumors. or the 1 in 88 babies born with autism;  The medical industry will find a cure. Right???  So far not one disease has been cured by science.  http://www.acco.org/Information/AboutChildhoodCancer/ChildhoodCancerStatistics.aspx They just continue to rise because of human ignorance.  Medical Industry: Without the medical industry humans would already be extinct. We have over 17000 genetic disease and so many pathogens that would wipe us out that humans cultivated out of ignorance, we would not be here without antibiotic, anti-fungal, vaccines. This is obvious from the evidence.  They have managed to make vaccines to stop polio and small pox but that is not a cure. The cure would be to have all humans not be affected by them at all with no vaccine (restored immune DNA).  And for sure they have no cures for genetic deformity except corrective surgery and deleterious mutations.  I don’t think they have enough brain power left to even know how to or what to do without killing more people or making mutant freaks from accidents out of them, in the process.  With heart surgery it is ""plumbing work"" and attaching parts of arteries taken from other parts of the body.   Cataract surgery is wonderful but does nothing about the genetic defects; the cause nor the cure. Medical industry has enzyme replacements, hormone replacements  lens replacements, and a huge number of medicines that reduce body functions to help with pain etc. Cancer treatments are horrible and the remission rate is not that good.  They give statistics on 5 years of life after cancer as ""success"" . In the mean time the rates of cancer rise at phenomenally rapid increases. The childhood cancer is just to harsh to believe.   ^ Muller, G. B.

Back 3000 years ago they did not have even a microscope (did not need one), but they had Jehovah's direct instructions on how to preserve life.   Are Humans Getting Better? What is Really Going On? by James Arjuna  There is ONLY degeneration shown in ALL HUMAN studies of DNA.  There are well over 10,000,000 peer reviewed papers from all over the world clearly showing that humans are degraded, have never ""evolved"" and at the present rate of the rise of genetic defects our species will be reduced to stupid short living animals with no technology, no speech, no intelligence. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=Human+Genetic+Diseases  There are NO beneficial mutations ever found in DNA evidence. http://evolutionsciencenow.blogspot.com/2013/06/evolutions-beneficial-mutations.html  Try this search term and see if you can find any beneficial mutations.  I have spent thousands of hours on that and so far not one beneficial mutation has ever been shown to exist. This search of all the data bases in the world sums up with over 2,000,000 articles and NO beneficial mutations. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Human+Mutations  In all these peer Science studies we find some estimated 20,000 pseudo genes. Pseudo genes are genes that used to code for human cells.  Now they are dead and fading away. Some of them are barely perceivable because of this fading of this coding.   They have completely mapped and studied 14000 of them so far.  http://www.pseudogene.org/human/index.php   http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/9/R51  According to this study we have lost close to 45% of our coding that made us much stronger and much more healthy, fit and much more intelligent.   For those who do not understand math:   Original number of coding genes approximately 45,000;  Coding genes we have now approximately 25,000.  Number of pseudo genes (dead genes) no longer coding for body parts 20,000.   20,000 + 25,000 = 45,000 original genes. 45,000 x 45% = 20250 lost genes.  Actual precise number is 20,000/45,000 = .444444  or 44.4%.  Dr. Gerald Crabtree a renowned geneticists and professor of genetics at Stanford University states that “I would wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions, with a good memory, a broad range of ideas, and a clear-sighted view of important issues.

Fay1,2* 1 Computational and Systems Biology Program, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America, 2 Department of Genetics and Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America: ""Evidence for Hitchhiking of Deleterious Mutations within the Human Genome"" According to this article of 1000 samples of human genomes, there is an average of 1000 deleterious mutations per person. Quote: ""Each human is estimated to carry on the order of 1,000 deleterious mutations in their genome."" These are FIXED (permanent) in the reproductive process.  The governments do not want anyone to be concerned and want you to believe that ""big brother and science"" Is taking good care of us and don't worry about 200% rise in babies with brain/spinal tumors. or the 1 in 88 babies born with autism;  The medical industry will find a cure. Right???  So far not one disease has been cured by science.  http://www.acco.org/Information/AboutChildhoodCancer/ChildhoodCancerStatistics.aspx They just continue to rise because of human ignorance.  Medical Industry: Without the medical industry humans would already be extinct. We have over 17000 genetic disease and so many pathogens that would wipe us out that humans cultivated out of ignorance, we would not be here without antibiotic, anti-fungal, vaccines. This is obvious from the evidence.  They have managed to make vaccines to stop polio and small pox but that is not a cure. The cure would be to have all humans not be affected by them at all with no vaccine (restored immune DNA).  And for sure they have no cures for genetic deformity except corrective surgery and deleterious mutations.  I don’t think they have enough brain power left to even know how to or what to do without killing more people or making mutant freaks from accidents out of them, in the process.  With heart surgery it is ""plumbing work"" and attaching parts of arteries taken from other parts of the body.   Cataract surgery is wonderful but does nothing about the genetic defects; the cause nor the cure. Medical industry has enzyme replacements, hormone replacements  lens replacements, and a huge number of medicines that reduce body functions to help with pain etc. Cancer treatments are horrible and the remission rate is not that good.  They give statistics on 5 years of life after cancer as ""success"" . In the mean time the rates of cancer rise at phenomenally rapid increases. The childhood cancer is just to harsh to believe.   ^ Muller, G. B.

You claim that you can't make a creature evolve in your garage, well that's a very stupid analogy to claim Evolution is not real. We have paleontologic evidence that proves that Evolution is happening, happened, and will continue happening. And we know since a lot of years ago that the DNA, what makes pluricelular life and evolution possible, really exists and can be changed by man, altering the stucture of an embryo and creating a new life. If Evolution is not real, then DNA shouldn't be either, how do you explain that? We get primarily fossilized evidence that shows us that birds evolved from coelurosaurian dinosaurs, mammals from ancient reptiles and humans from early primates (not directly form chimpanzees, although they share 99% of our DNA) Read about this: Hyracotherium:http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/h/hyracotherium.html http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-0931-4_3#page-1 Archaeopterix http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1976.tb00244.x/abstract http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/birds/archaeopteryx.html Anatosuchus https://www.tumblr.com/search/Anatosuchus Kannemeyeria http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/predinosaurreptiles/p/kannemeyeria.htm http://www.sbpbrasil.org/revista/edicoes/9_3/323a332_Andrade.pdf Therapsids (reptile ancestors of mammals) http://www.huecotanks.com/debunk/therapsd.htm http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003733#pone-0003733-g007 And Australopitecus afarensis, ancestor of humans http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1556/3355.full http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_piths.html The Big Bang was theorized after the failure of Albert Einstein to prove his model of an infinite and always still universe. After the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), which was predicted by the theories about the Big Bang, we came to the conclussion that the residual radiation was, together with the cosmic redshift-distance relation, the best evidence supporting the model of an Universe starting in the Big Bang, and we know it's 13,7 billion thanks to precise measurements on the background radiation and the age of oldest known stars. On this year, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the apparent detection of gravitational waves, which if confirmed, will povide strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang. The theory of the Big Bang is not a useless belief, it's the truth, and phycisists are getting closer to the truth about what happened on the beginning of existance, due to experimentation, observation and evaluation of our evidence. You can't just simply say it's not truth because it is what Scientists consider as the most acceptable theory (how is that thinking rational, anyway?) and use it to discredit Creationism, when creationists don't even have any rational argument to support their belief. We don't need ""faith"" to prove science is right, we need evidence and rational thinking, and this is exactly what happened with the Big Bang, Evolution, and such other theories that has been proven and now are part of today's paradigm.﻿ Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994ApJ...420..439M http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-cosmic-microw/ Age of the universe http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=45 http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/563/2/L95  Here I gave you evidence to my arguments AND sources, so if you are going to reply with any of your creationist B.S. or misleading philosophical arguments that would left the fool around the corner as smarter than Descartes in comparison, please, f*** off.",0,2014-11-11T04:55:10.000Z,0.0969930969931,0.34947934947899995,en,scientificamerican,http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-cosmic-microw/,False,False

I am and always will be a Scientist... But I ask... If there was a God why did he appear to Moses...and then disappear for millenniums??? Why did he create sin??? Why did he kill so many innocent children and animals in the flood??? Why did he approve of stoning your children if they did not obey you? Why did he approve of slavery??? Why was he so misogynistic ??? Why did he not know the difference between a whale and a fish... or a bat and a bird??? If there was a God why does he not appear to us today??? If there was a God why does he need us to prove to him that we adore him and worship him if we are to get into heaven... is he so insecure that he constantly needs to feel as though we all worship him???? Why did he create sin??? Why did he create hell??? He cares about the planet??? You have got to be fucking kidding me !!!!! He made us for a purpose??? Clearly that purpose was to just fuck with us... fuck with our brains... fuck with our children... fuck with our lives !!! Fuck the slaves, rape the woman if you want to marry her, and send your daughters to be raped by your enemy  if you prefer the angels !!! Holy fuck the whole Bible is a nightmare of rape, murder, slavery, misogyny, contradictions, injustice,cruelty and violence... anyone who reads through it from cover to cover is bound to have nightmares for the rest of their life http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/index.htm  Oh damn I have a thousand questions like those above !! And the answer ""God works in mysterious ways"" means fuck all !!!  Then I ask myself... if I ie ME was an all powerful, all knowing God would I be such a total asshole to create the world as it is??? Would I create sin,suffering, disease, famine, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, starvation,climate change, Satan, Hell, murderers, slavery, terrorism, piracy, drugs of dependence, rapists, pedophiles, guns, nuclear weapons... oh how the list could go on and on.... and then after creating this world of suffering would I then expect all humans to worship me for the glory of my creation????.. and the answer is a resounding ... NO !!! If I was an all knowing all powerful God ""I"" would create a fucking Utopia, where there was no evil, no inequality, no crime, no sin, no famine, no disease, no obesity, no death, and only sunshine and happiness!! Everyone would have everything they needed and would be just sitting around at the local pub drinking and eating and chatting and laughing in the sunshine with their friends, not giving a shit about how they were going to get home, or the fact that they had to go to work tomorrow, or how fat that meal of Thai Green Curry was gonna make them lol !!! Or we would all be out surfing, snow skiing, bungee jumping, driving a ferrari around a racetrack or skydiving without fear of something going wrong and hurting ourselves. Let's face it... dream of your most exciting pleasure, and if I was God then I would have made that possible for you !!!!  So I therefore believe that if there was a God, and if he did create all of this...then he must be the most fucking sadistic creature that has ever existed. The Bible records the deaths he personally caused or commanded his followers to cause... total 25 million... compared to Satan's 40 deaths in the Bible... let's face it he is definitely the greatest murderer of all time if you are to believe the Bible !!! http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com.au/2007/01/how-many-has-god-killed-complete-list.html  And because I cannot believe that an all knowing all powerful God would be such a sadistic, murderous asshole I don't believe he exists. I could be better persuaded to believe in many of the other Gods of the world who are much more gentle and forgiving.  But I am a Scientist...and I have yet to find any evidence that supports the existence of any Gods !! You say he left us with the Bible that modern Science only recently discovered... you have got to be joking...  I have read, annotated and studied the Bible in depth - believe me there is virtually NO scientific knowledge in the Bible. If God wrote the Bible then I could write you a list a mile long of things he got wrong eg whales are fish, bats are birds, a human can exist in a whale's gut for 3 days and nights, every species of animal can fit on a boat 450 metres long da da I can't remember the exact measurements but it cannot be done, the earth is the centre of the universe, the order of creation eg plants before the sun, it is something written by many men from thousands of years ago who had absolutely no fucking knowledge at all of science... get real !!!!  I cannot prove that no Gods exist... I cannot go searching the entire universe for Gods, the Burden of Proof is on those who believe in their existence to prove to me that they do exist. Which brings me to another line of thought... how do YOU know that YOUR God is the ""right"" God.... if you had have been born in India, Bali, Afghanistan or China you would have been indoctrinated by a totally different religious belief...with a different God !!!! If your parents had have been Mormons, Scientologists, Catholics, Baptists or Wesboro Baptists then that's the religion you would have been indoctrinated with from the time you were born !!!  Maybe the tooth fairy is real, maybe unicorns are real, maybe leprechauns are real...but until someone can actually prove their existence to me, they are not real. When you can prove the existence of YOUR God to me maybe I will have second thoughts on the matter! Until then I can only say that the definition of ""faith"" is ""a strong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof."" Faith does not require proofs, or evidence... I do !!!!  Scientists have many Theories.. for example the Theory of Gravity... The Germ Theory... The Theory of Relativity... to Scientists a Theory is LAW... If you don't believe in one of the Scientific Theories then theoretically you should not believe in any of them... because the Theory of Gravity has no more evidence than the Theory of Evolution... so next time you drop something and it falls to the ground... remember that is just one piece of evidence for the Theory of Gravity...  Next time you go to the doctor and he prescribes you a new antibiotic you have never heard of... because all of the bacteria are now resistant to the older antibiotics..want the Biblical treatment instead of trusting modern Science - then go home and fucking anoint yourself with the blood of a bird and pray your way to health !!!!  The major problem with creationists...they don't realise how often the theory of evolution is used in every day life to solve medical and scientific problems... so go pray for your health ...cos if you don't believe in evolution then you should not expect to benefit from the major medical advances the theory of evolution has contributed to...  http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/search/topicbrowse2.php?topic_id=47 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_medicine http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/of-what-value-is-evolutionary-biology-in-medicine/ Then there are the advances in horticultural food crops, animal breeding, regeneration of rainforests etc etc  Just go and bury your head in the sand and refuse to believe evolution is true...while the rest of the world just goes on without you... but when you are sick don't go calling the doctors ... cos there are many people who trust the scientists, the doctors, and the researchers... and they are much more deserving of our knowledge than you are !!!!  Religion only serves one purpose... to control the masses, and to make those who are at the top of the religious orders rich and powerful eg the televangelists and the people who run the large ministries, the Catholic Church etc Go ahead buy those DVD's and books from those creationist websites... they want your money !!!!

If rapes stop today (That 1 in 4) then 1 in 2 women will be childless.  They come up with all sort of excuses for been childless and all I have to do is point to the worst of society, and show that women there are having plenty of children, who grew up without very little issues, despite very little money or child care. Many women today are so deluded about raising children they come up with ridiculous comments. Today more women have children paid for by the State, as the State fill the role of the Husband, most often as the women have reject the man for the role, as many of them get more money from the state than if they shacked up with the man or boy who got them pregnant. Willingly I may add.  With media stories attacking men over many decades now. I am not surprise that men are refusing abusive and delusional women. With modern family and abuse Laws, more and more men are dropping out leaving women who are looking to be acted upon waiting in the desert of childless and bitterness about lack of men in their desert. The risks are very high for men to be deprived by the woman and her new husband (The State) of his family, that married or partnered up with a woman is very high risk. Playing the all or nothing Lottery, is very low risk by comparison. Russian Roulette is even less risk than partnering up with women nowadays where you have 1 in 5/6 chances having you life ruined by a revolving gun. With divorce and more women using parenteral alienation of the father from his Child, while having to pay for both the child and the abusing mother is making more and more men saying NO. Most men have no problems in paying for children upbringing, but having to pay for a women that do not provide a service or abuse him for the privilege of having her abusive ass in his present. Hell no. No one like to go to a shop or restaurant and be treated that way. You refuse to do business there, and go elsewhere or do without.  Here how far the problem goes up to recent years, but still many women are still in denial that this will happen to them. http://www.independent.ie/life/family/mothers-babies/one-in-five-women-still-childless-in-their-40s-30216701.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8191859/One-in-five-women-is-childless-by-age-of-45.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2075038/The-childless-generation-How-women-aged-45-childless-refuse-aisle.html England and Wales Government Statistics http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fertility-analysis/cohort-fertility--england-and-wales/2011/sty-1-in-5-women-are-childless-at-45.html  Back in 2008, 1 in 5 Women in the US (according tot he US Census Bureau) are childless by the time they reach 45.  ""The proportion of childless women has been increasing steadily by about one percentage point a year,"" said Jane Dye, the report's author. Not only are highly educated women delaying pregnancy, but they are also more likely to remain childless. The proportion of graduates or those with a professional degree without children aged 40 to 44 rises to more than 1 in 4- just over 25% at 27% childless. There is also a striking variation in the frequency of childless women according to their race or origin. The proportion of white women, excluding those of Hispanic origin, who have no children is much higher than other groups at 23%. That is nearly 1 in 4 White women remaining childless in the US. Most feminists are White females and educated white feminists are ore likely to remain childless. Hispanic women are the least likely to remain childless at 14%, with black women at 16% and Asian women at 18%. Source: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/usa1  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28785054 It is thought, that one in four women born in the 1970s, will reach the age of 45 without giving birth. Menopause can start between the age of 40 to 60's, Variations outside those age brackets do occur. They still do not know the cause, only that it will happen. http://www.webmd.com/menopause/features/menopause-age-prediction For those born in the 1960s that figure is already running at one in five will remain childless. As always they go and look for women who has medical difficulty in getting pregnant, rather that real reasons, why so many women are childless. That not including women who have no knowledge how sex works or do not want to have a child. It unbelievable there are still certain women in the world who do not understand or have the knowledge how babies are created or the process of where the babies are born. Cabbage patch that many families no longer plant or that friendly endangered stork perhaps? Since the 1970's the average age women gives birth have been rising steadily since the 1970's putting off having children. Many women born in the 1970's, life brimmed with glamorous parties and exotic travel, just wait for that perfect Job, that perfect man , that perfect house, In that perfect location, well remain, waiting, for that perfect life.  When I grew up in Ireland in a big family, I always though 1 in 10 women not having a child in their lifetime was huge figure. We are definitely catching up with the rest of the western world. Women who have children here, are still having multiples of children but not as big as their mother generations, just  popping out half of the number of children, which keep up the population replacement, just enough to prevent depopulation in the Island called Ireland.  But the number of women not having children did surprise me, it has nothing to do with the pill or contraception, that I can attests to. According to the study by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), 18.4pc of Irish women over 45 don't have children. This is the childbearing age as defined by the OECD. Italy tops the table with 24pc; Austria is second with 21.1pc, and England and Wales comes in third at 20.5pc. The top five is completed by the Netherlands, which falls just behind Ireland at 18.3pc. The figures are based on an OECD survey carried out between 2005 and 2010.  Most women excuses is: ""Multifaceted and Complex issue"" responses, just to muddy the waters, from preventing onlookers to see the real problem. Other excuses are ""gender pay gap"" or ""Child care costs"". They never look at other issues such as lack of men wanting to date their abusive and high risk asses, or men not wanting to have sex with them, never mind dating.   You see those are rejections that would force them to look at 1/. themselves, 2/. the abuse of Law and Courts and 3/. Society around them. It is easier to blame others and attack the male sex for all of their problems. http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4070917.ece http://www.evoke.ie/health/i-have-crash-landed-into-my-future-to-find-myself-40-single-and-childless-why-one-woman-decided-to-freeze-her-eggs/ http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fertility-analysis/cohort-fertility--england-and-wales/2011/sty-1-in-5-women-are-childless-at-45.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2075038/The-childless-generation-How-women-aged-45-childless-refuse-aisle.html As the saying goes, Excuses, Excuses , Excuses....",0,2015-01-26T19:47:24.000Z,0.182237130623,0.482517833616,en,webmd,http://www.webmd.com/menopause/features/menopause-age-prediction,False,False

This is because, morality in children above, say 1-2 years and in adults as well is a subjective one. Our moral clock can change. What was almost a taboo a century ago is no more a taboo. A woman might think it is immoral to walking around bare chested, but if the same woman was brought us or born in some native African or American culture where they walk naked, and she will join them as well. Etc  However, does that mean that morality is not objective? I would argue that morality is objective in only people who have not been influenced by any culture or religious beliefs. Some years back, some scientists demonstrated with an experiment that morality is indeed imprinted in us without any outside force. http://phys.org/news192693376.html   If a 6month old child who can barely recognise his own self know the difference between good and bad, then we have to ask ourselves, how did he know when he is just barely months old. If you ask the same child to tell you about the events 4 years later, he would not remember because we do not retain the memory of our infancy toddler years. In fact, if possible to repeat the same experiment with the same child 6 years later, provided that the child was brought up in a society that celebrate bad deed, the child will most like choose the bad doll as in the link above. This is because his moral clock has changed by the upbringing.   That is why, as Muslims, we believe that every child is born on a natural state of ""fitra"" pure human nature until of cause his or her parent or the society change that.   My logic, if a 5 month old child can tell between good and bad, then it must have been put there by someone. I say God (I am completely open to other explanations) if it is from God, then he, knowing that the child will most likely not retain this natural predisposition of morality due to parental or societal influences, will need a way to remind him or her about this natural predisposition, hence the scriptures. Torah, Gospel, Qur'an, psalms, and maybe some of the Hindu scriptures as well. God knows all. May he guide us all to the right path.   Be well my brother.

Personally,  I find that a penis is like a fine diamond.....always prettiest when it's cut just right.  :)  As far as the pro-circumcision/anti-circumcision debate, I approach it much like abortion, in that it should firmly remain a parental right for informed parents.  Parents need to be fully aware of all the medical benefits, as well as any possible risks, that come with it.  The AAP and the Center for Disease Control, out of multicultural consideration, don't call for across-the-board circumcisions on all males.  However, they do tacitly encourage it, given that controlled, peer-reviewed medical studies indicate that circumcision significantly reduces a man's risk for prostate cancer, penile cancer, highly unpleasant urinary-genital conditions, and sexually transmitted diseases.  The World Health Organization--a fully international org--has found that it actually reduces risk of HIV infection by 60%, and recommend it for this very reason.  If you're curious about learning more, I'd encourage you to check out their official policy statements on their websites.  There are some anti-circumcision folks that would like to describe standard, normative circumcision as some sort of 'abuse,' but really, trying to make illegal a parent's choice regarding a simple, non-harmful procedure that helps minimize their son's risk for cancer and STDs is itself incredibly abusive.  Just make sure it's done in a proper, sterile environment by qualified personnel.  (And, by the way--comparisons with so-called 'female circumcision' are just baseless and designed more to provoke a quick emotional reaction in gullible people, rather than encourage a considered, medically-sound line of thought.)

So is the amount of extra energy it is absorbing equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bombs a second. Not that insignificant.  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/nov/25/global-warming-counter-widget  What does ice melting and oceans warming have to do with CO2?  Well as the planet warms ice melts silly, exposing more ocean so it absorbs more light as ice reflects light. Thought that would be obvious. Yes correlation does not always mean causation but your hypothesis which shows no correlation proves no causation ie the oceans and atmosphere are still warming despite your explanation as to why they are so you claim they're not. If you don't believe my experiment try it for yourself.   So on cloudy days a bucket will be warmer. Are you now claiming CO2 causes clouds and cools the oceans? BUT they're still warming! What's your point here?   The PREDICTED AND OBSERVED cooling of the stratosphere IS predicted by models and theory IF CO2 is the cause. CO2 absorbs heat from being re emitted BACK to the upper atmosphere. Normally some of this energy is re absorbed by the upper atmosphere on it's way out. If more heat is trapped at the surface then less is re emitted to space reducing the amount of reflected heating, thus cooling the stratosphere. As observed. This is a key finger print of AGW. If it's ""natural"" warming the amount of heat entering and reflecting both increase.So both will warm. The opposite of what you claim. Ohh and CO2 and isn't saturated.  https://www.wunderground.com/resources/climate/strato_cooling.asp  GHGs explained by SHELL OIL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTlYYlRN0LY   before they shut down research and started on the path of propaganda like Exxon.   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/  No I did not say ""..a bucket of water in direct sunlight will NOT warm more than a bucket right beside it but in shade?"" What I said is that 2 buckets kept in a room of different temperatures the bucket in the warmer room will be warmer ie if all other things are the same eg solar output etc then as the planet warms the land oceans must warm also. Are you being deliberately misleading here. As you don't understand GHG theory try the basics here it explains how GHGs stop heat from being re emitted to space thus insulating the planet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect  Try your calculations again before you childishly call people names, as the sun is CONTINUALLY adding energy unless it's lost to space temperatures would just keep going up and up and up and everything would melt.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget  Ohh don't say Watts is still banging on about his weather station BS. Strangely after Watts did his famous trip to find ""approved"" weather stations he forgot to mention weather stations had already calibrated for everything he claimed. And when the results were recalculated using only his ""approved"" stations they found the same thing..warming by the same amount.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcxVwEfq4bM&t=175s",0,2017-09-24T01:53:55.000Z,0.109780294232,0.430579752226,en,scientificamerican,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/,False,False

Your talking about 1 mechanism for heating and pretending any other doesn't exist. Sean para1 read what I said again. As oceans warn ice melts. Ice reflex sunlight. With less ice more ocean is exposed it absorbs more AND reflex less light heating it. Doesn't matter how inefficient you think energy transfer is it still happens. CO2 acts as an insulator and can stop heat transfer from the ocean to atmosphere to, also warming it. Just as a drink in a polystyrene holder stays warmer or for longer. As you point out oceans are very good at loosing heat to the atmosphere. More insulation, less heat loss, another way the ocean gains heat. But we could look at your hypothesis and compare it to GHG theory and reality. If oceans can only gain heat from the sun then they, like the atmosphere should be cooling. However the oceans and atmosphere are going in the opposite direction and WARMING. Your hypothesis does not fit reality.  You're wrong as your analogy addresses no such thing. Here's another experiment put 2 buckets in 2 rooms 1 at 50 deg 1 at 55 deg come back in a week and the 1 at 55 deg will be warmer because adding CO2 doesn't stop the sun shinning. Or put a bucket of warm water in an portable cooler and 1 in the open overnight. The 1 in the cooler will have lost less heat. Your not trying to boil oceans but only a few deg makes a huge difference. The difference between an ice age and now is only a few degrees.  Mann's hockey stick has been ""thoroughly discredited"" by lies, half truths and propaganda by the FF industry. Study after study have found the same thing. What you are trying to do is show a correlation. If [CO2] correlates with temperature over a time scales of 100's of years and millions of years, as it's shown to happen, why wouldn't it correlate now? If GHGs insulate in the lab and in theory why doesn't CO2 produced by Man behave the same way? What makes CO2 produced by Man different to ""natural"" CO2 How does the climate know NOT to warm from Man's CO2 emissions and only ""natural"" sources like volcanoes etc?    But your rant on chaotic systems misses a lot. You can tell a superimposed chaotic signal (background noise of weather) on a steady increasing influence of rising temperatures. Just as we know smoking causes increases in cancer rates on the ""chaotic"" background noise of natural cancer rates. 1 doesn't preclude the other. But it's precisely the feedback systems the deniers don't account for such as the formation of clouds that insulate the planet and warm it, cancelling out the effect of cloud reflection. Or as more water evaporates more GHG insulation occurs causing more warming. And yes the Predicted and OBSERVED cooling of the stratosphere is damning to AGW theory? Just like the observed warming of the oceans and air I guess. As for your ridiculous claim that CO2 absorbs 10 times as much IR than is available!  You've been had by the AGW FF employees, bad science, and an education system and political and media system owned by the FF industry that didn't give you the tools to analyze it for yourself.  https://www.skepticalscience.com/10-Indicators-of-a-Human-Fingerprint-on-Climate-Change.html http://www.ucsusa.org/ten-signs-global-warming-and-climate-change-are-happening#.WcSy0MgjHIU https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/",0,2017-09-22T07:25:39.000Z,0.10347826087000002,0.460434782609,en,skepticalscience,https://www.skepticalscience.com/10-Indicators-of-a-Human-Fingerprint-on-Climate-Change.html,False,False

CO2 acts as an insulator and can stop heat transfer from the ocean to atmosphere to, also warming it. Just as a drink in a polystyrene holder stays warmer or for longer. As you point out oceans are very good at loosing heat to the atmosphere. More insulation, less heat loss, another way the ocean gains heat. But we could look at your hypothesis and compare it to GHG theory and reality. If oceans can only gain heat from the sun then they, like the atmosphere should be cooling. However the oceans and atmosphere are going in the opposite direction and WARMING. Your hypothesis does not fit reality.  You're wrong as your analogy addresses no such thing. Here's another experiment put 2 buckets in 2 rooms 1 at 50 deg 1 at 55 deg come back in a week and the 1 at 55 deg will be warmer because adding CO2 doesn't stop the sun shinning. Or put a bucket of warm water in an portable cooler and 1 in the open overnight. The 1 in the cooler will have lost less heat. Your not trying to boil oceans but only a few deg makes a huge difference. The difference between an ice age and now is only a few degrees.  Mann's hockey stick has been ""thoroughly discredited"" by lies, half truths and propaganda by the FF industry. Study after study have found the same thing. What you are trying to do is show a correlation. If [CO2] correlates with temperature over a time scales of 100's of years and millions of years, as it's shown to happen, why wouldn't it correlate now? If GHGs insulate in the lab and in theory why doesn't CO2 produced by Man behave the same way? What makes CO2 produced by Man different to ""natural"" CO2 How does the climate know NOT to warm from Man's CO2 emissions and only ""natural"" sources like volcanoes etc?    But your rant on chaotic systems misses a lot. You can tell a superimposed chaotic signal (background noise of weather) on a steady increasing influence of rising temperatures. Just as we know smoking causes increases in cancer rates on the ""chaotic"" background noise of natural cancer rates. 1 doesn't preclude the other. But it's precisely the feedback systems the deniers don't account for such as the formation of clouds that insulate the planet and warm it, cancelling out the effect of cloud reflection. Or as more water evaporates more GHG insulation occurs causing more warming. And yes the Predicted and OBSERVED cooling of the stratosphere is damning to AGW theory? Just like the observed warming of the oceans and air I guess. As for your ridiculous claim that CO2 absorbs 10 times as much IR than is available!  You've been had by the AGW FF employees, bad science, and an education system and political and media system owned by the FF industry that didn't give you the tools to analyze it for yourself.  https://www.skepticalscience.com/10-Indicators-of-a-Human-Fingerprint-on-Climate-Change.html http://www.ucsusa.org/ten-signs-global-warming-and-climate-change-are-happening#.WcSy0MgjHIU https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/",0,2017-09-22T07:25:39.000Z,0.10347826087000002,0.460434782609,en,scientificamerican,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/,False,False

I doubt you will have very many theologians or history professors (atheists or theists) who would agree with that statement. Where are your references? Was it majority of history scholars? Who said it and what evidence backs up their claim? I have studied this subject for many years and here are few references of historical proof of Jesus:  http://evidencetobelieve.net/history-of-jesus/  I do remember a bible verse about Egypt (prediction has still held up): ""I will turn the fortunes of Egypt and make them return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom. ""It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will never again lift itself up above the nations. And I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations."" - Ezekiel 29:14-15  gospel accounts, they are all different? So? They were written by different authors over many years; I haven't see ANY scriptures which contradict each other.   The Jews were beginning to revolt and the govt. needed a Messiah figure? So the most powerful nation on earth with the largest army needed Jesus to control the population? Where do you get these ideas? Any references of history books or quotes by ancient historical authors to back your claim? I find it doesn't make a lot of sense, plus why create a messiah when the emperors where considered to be god like.  It is time we all stopped leaning on religion? I think over the next years YOU and I will need what the Christian religion can offer, why? we heading towards End of Days. You can ignore it like those on the Titanic who refused to get those small wooden life boats because this massive ship will never sink. Did you know some of Titanic's life boats were only half-full when they were rescued. Jesus is NOW giving us warning that this earth will soon be in the times of tribulation like has never seen before.  I've been a Christian for over thirty years and I have used my brain to write this comment to you. Did you know that greatest scientific discovery at CERN at Geneva may prove the bible is correct. The bible has ALWAYS stated about unknown places we cannot see or touch called Heaven and Hell or multi-verses. The discovery at CERN was Higgs Boson was revealed at 126 GEV at 5 sigma accuracy. You may say ""so""? If you anything about the experiments at CERN it all came down to supersymmetry vs multi-verse. It looks like multi-verse concept won.... don't believe me?   ""Physicists have gone through three generations of particle accelerators searching for new particles, posited by a theory called supersymmetry, that would drive the Higgs mass down exactly as much as the known particles drive it up. But so far they’ve come up empty-handed.""  ""However, in order for the Higgs boson to make sense with the mass (or equivalent energy) it was determined to have, the LHC needed to find a swarm of other particles, too. None turned up.""    “I would be happy personally if the multiverse interpretation is not correct, in part because it potentially limits our ability to understand the laws of physics. But none of us were consulted when the universe was created.” - Edward Witten                  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-physics-complications-lend-support-to-multiverse-hypothesis/",0,2015-10-31T00:59:49.000Z,0.103816738817,0.429733044733,en,scientificamerican,http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-physics-complications-lend-support-to-multiverse-hypothesis/,False,False

The only necessary supplement is B12. This vitamin is produced by bacteria, not animals. Vitamin D is recommended, but that goes for every human being on any diet because we spend so little time outdoors now. Omega-3 is another that should be considered, if flax, hemp, chia, walnuts etc. are not a regular part of the diet. There are vegan sources of bioavailable DHA and EPA in algal oil -- it's where the fish get it to begin with.  Also, you are assuming that every study on vegan diets has failed to control for lifestyle characteristics. That is simply untrue.  Consider these randomized, controlled clinical trials (you know what ""randomized"" means, right?):  *Diabetes trial:* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339401  ""a [randomly assigned] low-fat vegan diet appeared to improve glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet recommendations""  *Geico Study:* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524383  ""[18 week randomized vegan diet instruction vs. control resulted in] improvements in impairment because of health (p < .001), overall work impairment because of health (p = .02), non-work-related activity impairment because of health (p < .001), depression (p = .02), anxiety (p = .04), fatigue (p < .001), emotional well-being (p = .01), daily functioning because of physical health (p = .01), and general health (p = 0.02) in the *intervention group* were *significantly greater than in the control group*""  *Cancer patient intervention:* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18237581  ""Analyses of changes in dietary intake of macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and isoflavones from baseline to 1 year showed significantly increased intake of most protective dietary factors (eg, fiber increased from a mean of 31 to 59 g/day, lycopene increased from 8,693 to 34,464 mug/day) and significantly decreased intake of most pathogenic dietary factors (eg, saturated fatty acids decreased from 20 to 5 g/day, cholesterol decreased from 200 to 10 mg/day) in the intervention group compared to controls.

Also, the ""The Great Porn Experiment"" you tube movie, has it's comments section closed off (which is bad because it means the people who posted that movie are unwilling to defend the points made in that video) and only points back to the ""Your brain on porn"" website indirectly because the guy hosting the event depicted hosts that website.  And it sounds like Gary Wilson draws the same information from the same heavily disputed article that you do.  So...  Underwhelming as a reference.  Also as a point of interest on Gary Wilson as I can tell, he just assumes that if you look at porn and get erectile dysfunction, then it must be because of pornography.  And not at all one of the many other reasons a person can get erectile dysfuntion like stress, drugs (prescription, over the counter, or otherwise), smoking and drinking (I know it fits in with drugs but these habbit is so common it deserves it's own point I feel), performance anxiety, bicycling, diabetes, bad feelings related to relationship problems, I honestly could go on.  My point here is that Gary Wilson latches on to ""Porn"" as an explanation but many sites I have checked for causes don't list excessive porn use as a cause.  http://www.healthline.com/health-slideshow/common-causes-of-impotence#1 http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/basics/causes/con-20034244 http://www.emedicinehealth.com/causes_of_erectile_dysfunction/article_em.htm  Your other references point only to abstracts that don't allow the whole article to be scrutinized as a whole (at least now without going though a pay-wall to get at it.) and mainly point towards drug addictions or are studies that point to mixed results in relationships where people view porn.  Some of these articles say that it has a negative impact on men but a positive impact on women.  Most of them say that little is known about the effects of pornography on people at this time.  They are also, often, old even by the time this video was produced.  I don't dispute that physical substances like cocaine and alcohol affect your brain negatively and most likely permanently, but I take issue with the idea that porn is somehow worse for your brains functioning than having sex with a real life partner.  Or for that matter I don't see how looking at porn is any worse for your brain than playing a good video game, reading a book, talking with neighbors and friends, going shopping, going for a drive, eating fast food...  Lastly I'd like to point out that Gary Wilson, Donald L. Hilton Jr., Clark Watts and many others who purport that porn is ""damaging to the mind"" tend to suffer from confirmation bias.  They latch on to what supports their position without examining alternative explanations for why certain things happen.  I will leave people whom have read my comment with this however.  I know and understand that anything done in excess can be bad for you.",0,2014-10-30T05:32:09.000Z,0.0336324491112,0.5059519204199999,en,healthline,http://www.healthline.com/health-slideshow/common-causes-of-impotence#1,False,False

It is founded on the belief that the goddess of natural selection was omnipresent and omniscient in a mythical primordial soup, and that she would have taken a self replicating molecule that would have fortuitously appeared in some toxic mix,  through billions of years of a fantastic evolutionary voyage.  Funny that atheists like Dawkins and others would have adopted the modern myth in order to rationalize their atheism. ""4 BILLION years before present: the surface of a newly formed planet around a medium-sized star is beginning to cool down. It’s a violent place, bombarded by meteorites and riven by volcanic eruptions, with an atmosphere full of toxic gases. But almost as soon as water begins to form pools and oceans on its surface, something extraordinary happens. A molecule, or perhaps a set of molecules, capable of replicating itself arises. This was the dawn of evolution. Once the first self-replicating entities appeared, natural selection kicked in, favouring any offspring with variations that made them better at replicating themselves. Soon the first simple cells appeared. The rest is prehistory. Billions of years later, some of the descendants of those first cells evolved into organisms intelligent enough to wonder what their very earliest ancestor was like.

Right now, despite the research coming back negative about cholesterol being a problem (see the Framingham study), they STILL harp on their patients to eat a low fat, low cholesterol diet. Why? Because they have no idea of what else to say. Right now, we're starting to see research on how elevated blood SUGAR is the problem, because we know that over time, it damages the blood vessel walls. Salt; they only know one thing for sure, that once you DO have high blood pressure, THEN decreasing salt intake will help control it. But salt on it's own does not cause high blood pressure. I, and many others, are perfect examples. When something is definitely a cause of a disease process, it's always positive, not just sometimes. And that's the problem they're facing now; they can't find the proverbial smoking gun which they can blame high blood pressure on. So they grasp at straws, hoping to decrease the problem of hypertension in at least as many patients as they can. The problem becomes, they try to tell EVERYONE that they have to limit their salt intake, which is incorrect. We see this over and over in western medicine; I first noticed it with the cholesterol myth, then salt, and narcotics. There is this current 'war against opiates', all because a few percent get addicted to it. So they make it harder for all the patients with chronic pain AND acute pain to get pain relief; my current e.r. has an unspoken policy, if you don't have a broken bone, no opiates. Ridiculous!  I'm a nurse, and I see these problems every day I work. Oh, and whenever you see a study, look into who is funding it, who is involved with it, and what they've pushed as their hypothesis previously. As far as showing you the studies, all I can do is suggest you google and read. I've read the studies over the years as they came out; I can suggest the Lancet, the NEJM, Science, oh, and Science News. But I don't catalog them. Science news comes out every other week, with interesting articles, easy to read, and with references. https://www.sciencenews.org  It's a short magazine that you can read quickly during a coffee break or lunch. Comes out every other week, and they also have a web presence. But remember, never take one article, or source, as gospel.

So lets begin with the environment. There are enough studies to prove that 51% of greenhouse gas emissions comes from Animal Agriculture. Over 60 billion animals are bred into existence every year, the methane from the animals which is greenhouse gas is worse than carbon dioxide. Also, all the waste from these animals goes into oceans creating massive dead zones. Deforestation is another problem, because over billions are being bred and the numbers keep going up every year a rainforest, the size of a football pitch, is burnt down. 70% of our oxygen comes from marine plants (the ocean) while the remaining percentage comes from rainforests. We are essentially destroying our own home, the planet, making us the dumbest specie to exist. There are enough crops to feed people in under-developed countries. 80% of soy goes to animals in the meat, dairy and egg industries while the rest to humans. If the world went vegan there will be enough crops to feed the world without the need for further deforestation.  Watch Cowspiracy on Netflix (go to their website to read the sources http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/) and read this: http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294.   As for health, in moderate amounts still causes illnesses. Read this about egg (in a moderate amount) https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/87/4/799/4633474 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390963. It compares it to smoking and how even one egg is bad for you, just like smoking one cigarette. Again there are enough studies that have found that cholesterol causes cardiovascular disease such as heart disease as well as colon cancer. Cholesterol is only found in animal protein – a fatty, sticky substance that can clog up our arteries. A vegan diet reverses heart disease. IGF-1 is a growth hormone found in animal protein (meat, egg and dairy) that causes breast cancer and prostate cancer and spreads it to different parts of the body. In the UK, these two cancers are the most common and over 10 thousand people are dying every year from them. Eggs contain LDL Cholesterol which causes type 2 diabetes. Dairy makes our bones weaker and causes osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxnBDDqXSjk). Chickens contain Arsenic (which is a cancerous substance) causes neurocognitive deficits and cancer.

Is there a debate whether or not children should be exposed to violent content? I didn't think so. Of course not! I though it was about 16/18 - ... years old gamer's. I'm personally only interested in the effects on adults, since effects on children isn't something with destructive implications like banning the game. It just means, paying attention (or heightening) age restrictions. And I suppose the average gamer who play's such content is least above 16 years. I hope so. *_*  I would make a strong distinction between findings of effects on children and adults since both have completely different implications.  __Now just a general take on science and video games__  There is a difference between short term and long term effects. Many (often experimental) studies in terms of video game violence only look at short term effects(1). Another problem is that they often use two different, self selected groups of people and check them individually. Not what effect has X on the same people. Who will the same people think after watching this? And how long does that effect last? Are there things (like watching other content afterwards, or going shopping, making sports, eating, reading, the next morning etc. - normal things many of us do) that moderate or reverse that effect?  I think the best studies would be longitudinal studies that go over 1 year or 2, like this German one about sexism(2) that found no link between sexism (first order effects) and video game usage.  My problem with (short term) experimental study results are: Let's make something up, let's say, you let me play a video game and I'm 10% more aggressive than before after doing so... this effect HAS TO reverse, decay, or be inconsistent! Otherwise every time I would play a violent video game this effect would happen. Every time a 10% increase in aggression. At some point my aggression level would be at 1000%! This is stupid! And let's say I have played violent video games before this test... let's say 20 times. Wouldn't I already be 200% more aggressive than before playing them? And I'm, like most other people not an friggin' angel. Most people have a certain degree of violent aggression within them, especially when they're young. So a 200% increase would be rather astronomical. That's why a ""you are 10% more aggressive result"" wouldn't bother me very much. Because it MUST decrease to some extent. Otherwise everyone who plays violent video games daily, for 1 year would be 3600% more aggressive than when they started. Stupid.  Same with sexism. If every time I watched ""sexist"" content my tolerance of sexual harassment, as claimed here(3) would increase, at some point I would be cheering and celebrating sexual harassment, or just not care at all.  I have watched lot's of content in the past, that joy kills would call sexist.objectification.demeaning.exploitation.blup content and I took the little harassment survey of this study(3) and was very harsh with the Mr. Grabbers in this story. So when does my effect kick in? If ""sexist"" content I watched in the past increased  And if my effect got reversed or moderated by my awareness that there is a possibility that media influences my judgement of such things, then a simple semi-fix would be informing people. Viewers discretion advised.   Another problem is that experimental studies that show effects which aren't truly strong (like with most ""media washes your brain studies""), is that they often aren't very repeatable(4). When repeated, the follow up experiments often reveal weaker effects than the original study. And ""media washes your brain"" stuff is most definitely AT LEAST ambiguous.(5)    And let's not forget publication bias.(6) For my taste there are far to little published psychological/experimental studies in the field of video game influence.

Is there a debate whether or not children should be exposed to violent content? I didn't think so. Of course not! I though it was about 16/18 - ... years old gamer's. I'm personally only interested in the effects on adults, since effects on children isn't something with destructive implications like banning the game. It just means, paying attention (or heightening) age restrictions. And I suppose the average gamer who play's such content is least above 16 years. I hope so. *_*  I would make a strong distinction between findings of effects on children and adults since both have completely different implications.  __Now just a general take on science and video games__  There is a difference between short term and long term effects. Many (often experimental) studies in terms of video game violence only look at short term effects(1). Another problem is that they often use two different, self selected groups of people and check them individually. Not what effect has X on the same people. Who will the same people think after watching this? And how long does that effect last? Are there things (like watching other content afterwards, or going shopping, making sports, eating, reading, the next morning etc. - normal things many of us do) that moderate or reverse that effect?  I think the best studies would be longitudinal studies that go over 1 year or 2, like this German one about sexism(2) that found no link between sexism (first order effects) and video game usage.  My problem with (short term) experimental study results are: Let's make something up, let's say, you let me play a video game and I'm 10% more aggressive than before after doing so... this effect HAS TO reverse, decay, or be inconsistent! Otherwise every time I would play a violent video game this effect would happen. Every time a 10% increase in aggression. At some point my aggression level would be at 1000%! This is stupid! And let's say I have played violent video games before this test... let's say 20 times. Wouldn't I already be 200% more aggressive than before playing them? And I'm, like most other people not an friggin' angel. Most people have a certain degree of violent aggression within them, especially when they're young. So a 200% increase would be rather astronomical. That's why a ""you are 10% more aggressive result"" wouldn't bother me very much. Because it MUST decrease to some extent. Otherwise everyone who plays violent video games daily, for 1 year would be 3600% more aggressive than when they started. Stupid.  Same with sexism. If every time I watched ""sexist"" content my tolerance of sexual harassment, as claimed here(3) would increase, at some point I would be cheering and celebrating sexual harassment, or just not care at all.  I have watched lot's of content in the past, that joy kills would call sexist.objectification.demeaning.exploitation.blup content and I took the little harassment survey of this study(3) and was very harsh with the Mr. Grabbers in this story. So when does my effect kick in? If ""sexist"" content I watched in the past increased  And if my effect got reversed or moderated by my awareness that there is a possibility that media influences my judgement of such things, then a simple semi-fix would be informing people. Viewers discretion advised.   Another problem is that experimental studies that show effects which aren't truly strong (like with most ""media washes your brain studies""), is that they often aren't very repeatable(4). When repeated, the follow up experiments often reveal weaker effects than the original study. And ""media washes your brain"" stuff is most definitely AT LEAST ambiguous.(5)    And let's not forget publication bias.(6) For my taste there are far to little published psychological/experimental studies in the field of video game influence. So it could be that many studies were conducted and most didn't find a significant effect and therefore didn't get published. I suspect most Journals are more interested in such effects, because that means further implications. While non-significant/negative results just mean - it's all fine for gamer's! And I suspect that isn't something that journals are so interested in, since they aren't gaming journals.

I do that because I think that it's better than not doing that, it makes me happier to not eat animals than to eat them.  But really crucially I don't think I'm on some kind of ethical charge just because I do one thing that is simple to do. I picked that list quite carefully, there are Jains who sweep the ground in front of them so they don't kill animals. They are driven by a religious conviction, a vegan could do so because of an ethical conviction based on a philosophy that it's wrong to cause unnecessary suffering and deaths to animals. Any insect I kill is unnecessary. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ac/94/16/ac9416096132b47b2fc61cf2ac626937.jpg There is one doing it.  There are people who live off the grid because they think there is some imminent Armageddon. You could do that because you have an ethical aversion to an industry that kills animals indiscriminately. Living off the grid you can get your power from solar, and buy your food from the shop like anybody else. There are 180,000 families in the US that live off grid according to this random website (I don't know if its reliable but I can't find any other estimates https://www.infoplease.com/science-health/environment-nature/living-grid ) There are people who buy only biodynamic food. For reasons other than ethical concerns perceived health benefits etc.  It is only the people not willing to do the actions who call them impractical, think of an argument with a meat eater who used convenience as an excuse to eat meat.     The emissions argument is just factually wrong. Here are some sources  http://whatsyourimpact.org/greenhouse-gases/carbon-dioxide-emissions  https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions  http://www.worldwatch.org/agriculture-and-livestock-remain-major-sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions-0 Now I'm not saying that agriculture doesn't lead to greenhouse gas emissions. It's just a straight lie to say it's the biggest though. All this information's out there, you just didn't look it up. Animal agriculture is a large portion of that figure but not all of it either, there are soya plantations in the Amazon that have a gigantic impact in terms of net CO2 emissions. You see living off the grid would have a significantly larger impact than veganism environmentally; possibly in terms of animal welfare also.   I really think that people should think about what they encourage people to sign up for when they preach the vegan lifestyle as an ethical pursuit. If you were told not to drive a car, and walk everywhere, by somebody because they were an environmental activist, and they said it was bad for the environment to pump CO2 into the air which a car does. So be it. But if you then see them riding a Harley Davidson, and they then say well I'm not riding a car. While it is technically true they still are putting CO2 into the environment. People can walk everywhere, but this person chooses not to. Therein lies his hypocrisy, because the essence of the message isn't not to ride a car, but rather not to put CO2 into the atmosphere, which their behaviour still does.",0,2017-05-25T20:55:21.000Z,-0.005874594155840001,0.609449404762,en,worldwatch,http://www.worldwatch.org/agriculture-and-livestock-remain-major-sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions-0,False,False

They just know that the Sun did not cause the recent global warming, while anthropogenic greenhouse gases did cause most of the post-1950s or post-1970s global warming. There are at least 6 different lines of evidence for this claim:  1) Significant global warming remains even after correcting for total solar irradiance (TSI). 2) The relationship between solar output and global warming fails a number of statistical tests and model-based tests. 3) Solar output has not correlated well with recent global warming. 4) The stratosphere cooled, in accordance with CO2-induced global warming, but not solar-induced warming. 5) Observed cooling of the mesosphere and thermosphere, atmospheric layers above the stratosphere, fits with CO2-induced global warming. 6) CO2 absorbs energy in particular wavelengths, shifting Earth's energy balance (the amount of energy the Earth takes up vs. the amount of energy the Earth releases). Climate sensitivity states how much warming results from CO2's energy absorption. Scientists estimate climate sensitivity in a number of ways, such as examining how much warming occurred with CO2 increases in the distant past. Scientists can then use these climate sensitivity estimates to determine how much of the recent global warming was caused by the increased CO2. When scientists apply these climate sensitivity estimates to recent CO2 levels and warming, it shows that increased CO2 caused most of the recent warming, not CO2.  Here's NASA dumbing it down:  ""But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the sun: - Since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the sun either remained constant or increased slightly. - If the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. - Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases."" http://climate.nasa.gov/causes/    *""Since the 2000s and the end of the solar maximum, other than the recent El Nino event, have global temperatures not been fairly flat if not slightly cooler?""*  Addressed by potholer54 in his video: ""The latest climate error from Steve Crowder""  From 4:13 to 4:59 in that video, he cites this paper:  ""Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate [...] Global warming is one of the main threats to mankind. There is growing evidence that anthropogenic greenhouse gases have become the dominant factor of climate change since about 1970, however the natural factors such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions cannot be neglected on longer time scales.

Clouds that develop from water vapor, can also act as fast positive feedback or as negative feedback, depending on how high those clouds are in the atmosphere. These effects are important, since CO2-induced global warming has augmented atmospheric water vapor levels, as expected, since warmer air can hold more moisture. So atmospheric humidity increased during the recent period of pronounced global warming (from about the late 1970s to the present), with a humidity decrease during the global cooling / temperature stagnation period of ~1940s to the 1970s.

I know, since I've read those papers. Here are a few of those papers:  ""Assessing the observed impact of anthropogenic climate change"" ""Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations"" ""Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance"" ""Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979–2005"" ""Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset"" ""A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming"" ""Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature"" ""Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change""    *""There is a good chance that a large part of the warming is just simply temperatures recovering after a very cold period ""LIA"", while the rest could be caused by the 8000 year peak in solar activity that lasted for DECADES.""*  You cited no evidence for your claims.

I didn't say that ""virtually all of the warming since *1800s* is from CO2"". I said that humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of the *post-1950s* global warming.  Anyway, temperatures don't just magically go up. Something causes them to go up. Your references to the Holocene do nothing to tell me what caused temperatures to go up; all you did was point out that temperatures went up. Your reference does nothing to change the fact that anthropogenic CO2 drove temperatures up. Here's some assigned reading for you on this:  ""Critics have argued that, if temperatures were as warm or warmer than current conditions before the onset of anthropogenic forcing, this would provide evidence that “natural” fluctuations alone could explain current conditions, since greenhouse gases were only ~280 ppmv during Medieval time (versus 400 ppmv today).

Several studies (Krinner et al., 2007; Uotila et al., 2007; Bengtsson et  al., 2011) have shown that the precipitation increase is directly linked to atmospheric warming via the increased moisture holding capacity of warmer air, and is therefore larger for scenarios of greater  warming. The relationship is exponential, resulting in an increase of SMB as a function of Antarctic SAT change evaluated in various recent studies with high-resolution (~60 km) models as 3.7% °C–1 (Bengtsson et al., 2011), 4.8% °C–1 (Ligtenberg et al., 2013) and ~7% °C–1 (Krinner et  al., 2007).

Here's NASA dumbing it down to your level:  ""Is the sun causing global warming? No. The sun can influence the Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards. One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun’s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun’s energy reaching Earth. A second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting “hotter.”"" http://climate.nasa.gov/faq/?

But apparently according to the DSM5 it is ""...a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning"". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder#Definition Essentially, in all things Psychology, it's really a pseudo-science and up to interpretation.

""...none of these musings reflect ot point towards a scientific basis for thinking that men can be born with female body parts, e.g., that they have a brain more similar to a woman than a man. The available evidence as we have it now appears to point to the opposite conclusion."" What sources are you thinking of? https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/ I've done tons of reading, spoken to many transgender people, read so many accounts and anecdotes, etc..... Similar to cruel gay conversion therapies, transgender people don't respond to anti-trans therapy. Whereas transitioning increases happiness (pertaining to varying resolutions of mind/body discord) and commonly resolves lifelong issues of anxiety or general feelings of disconnect that were thought (by the transperson in question) to be normal. Of course whatever society and individuals you're surrounded by affect how happy you're going to be transitioning; again, like coming out as gay, bigotry and violence directly affect you.  ""...I think there's a reason why 99.6% of the population has a gender identity that matches their biological sex."" For the same reason that any other given rare congenital condition appears? Since Darwin, it's become clear that DNA usually does a great job of following directions. Usually. Evolution and all those congenital conditions tells us that a small percentage of time it fails to build with 100% accuracy what it sought to. I don't understand why it seems so outlandish to suppose that occasionally, parts of a mind are built with a map that doesn't match the body. That said, there are some suppositions here that are false. Namely, the American/western cultural normalization of heterosexuality and binary genders. Biology/nature are not binary. They're spectrums. Other cultures throughout history have had ""third genders,"" homosexuality (for example) was normalized in ancient Greece, being born instersex is a real thing, modern science knows that there can be vast differences between brains of ""the same"" gender, etc..... When culture normalizes the false binary narrative and penalizes people for crossing social lines, for exploring themselves beyond this paradigm, yes, generally only the people who are on the extreme ends of the trans or (for example) non-hetero spectrum will figure out they're not who they thought they were. Who everyone was telling them they were. Some transpeople have such strong discord between their mind/body that they know something is wrong from childhood. So maybe they do everything they can to transition. However the body is mapped to the mind, it might not be as bad for others who realize things later and perhaps decide to only partially transition. I would bet that there are ""straight"" men who would maybe find themselves kissing the occasional guy if they were raised in a culture that recognized a spectrum or normalized that practice. And so on. We're all just genetics acted on by environment. We see closely related animals blur lines all the time.  Transracialism. Race isn't a biological or genetic thing. It's a social construct. Western black culture in LA is different from that in the deep south, which is different from Scottish culture, which is different every other culture/racial experience. I have an issue with the term transracialism because it implies the opposite, that it is about biology or genetics. But it's not. If you're raised Scottish, but traditional Japanese culture/racial experiences really appeal to you, great. Go live that way. You can like reading, rollercoasters, and types of art, and specific racial (which actually mean cultural) experiences feel right. It's all the same thing. To suggest that interests and art and such (race/culture) are biological is ludicrous and bigoted. Because that assumes that if you're black you're usually going to like fried chicken or other racist stereotypes and **** like that.",0,2017-05-13T22:56:14.000Z,0.0137921255959,0.44234026522,en,scientificamerican,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/,False,False

You are eating dietary cholesterol, saturated fat, plus a whole host of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E,K), omega 3 fatty acids, choline, and numerous other helpful vitamins. It is your body that produces LDL and HDL from what you eat. In general, eggs can increase your HDL and can also minimally increase your LDL. But the more important question is do they increase your risk for heart disease and stroke? We don’t die from high cholesterol. We die from heart attacks and strokes, so in the end, that is what we need to prevent.  It turns out, for the general population, there is no solid evidence that eggs increase our cardiovascular risk. There is some debate about people with diabetes eating more than 1 egg over day, but even that data is fairly weak.  Part of the problem could be the company it keeps.

And hey, I AM an atheist! I think atheists can be some really amazing, open-minded ND TOLERANT people, but they can also be preachy assholes, especially when they ridicule others for disagreeing with them, which is why I respect people's right to disagree, particularly as I have absolutely no knowledge as to whether or not my idea is right or not (which in reality makes me more an agnostic atheist.) I classify you, Vegan Gaines and other vegans in the Youtube community as militant because your response to ANY form of dissent is to close your eyes, put your fingers in your ears and shout as loud as you can ""NOOOO! NOOO! NOOO! VEGANISM IS THE ONLY WAY BECAUSE DOCUMENTARIES AND WEBSITES SAY SO!"" opposing any scenario that does not involve mass veganism and ignoring any information that contradicts your philosophy. Vegan Gaines does this CONSTANTLY in his videos and in comments sections, labeling any information that says veganism is slightly less then perfect as ""retarded"" or ""just making excuses."" Why? Well, first of all, he makes money off of being a vegan youtuber. Second of all, he's more interested in being right and protecting the ideology than he is in anything else (other than making money, of course.) And before you say anything, I HAVE looked at the vegan arguments. I went into the vegan arguments with a ""hit me with your best shot"" attitude. I spent about a year, year and a half, finding out what I could about veganism in whatever time I had to spare. Like any other religion/ideology, it looks nice on the outside, but if you scratch just a wee bit beneath the surface, it becomes infinitely more complicated. There are some good points, some points that are lies mixed with some truth, and quite a lot of bad points and some that are just outright bullshit.   No matter how many times a statistic is said, it doesn't make it true. There are varying numbers on just how bad factory farming is, hence why it is debatable. But again, whether it is 18% or 51% it is still a factor that needs to be taken seriously. Saying ""we should just stick with one and pass it off as the truth"" is what is commonly known as a lie. Should that lie be exposed, people are less likely to listen to you whatever estimate comes next, which is why it is important to settle on a number that can be backed with verifiable data. Saying something a bunch of times does not verifiable data make. Going back to the issue of atheism, if you had a bunch of people saying ""THERE IS NO GOD"" would that make it any less or more true? No. It wouldn't.   ""Third people slowly increasing their meat in take might eventually lead them towards veganism."" This is simply a far cry from what you said in the video, which was ""the vegan movement is growing."" ""Might eventually"" is mere speculation, not nearly enough to say ""the vegan movement is growing"" slowly or otherwise. In order to have growth, more people would actually have to be going full vegan, not just cutting back on their meat intake. Coupled with the fact that veganism and vegetarianism both have exceptionally high recidivism rates (84% of vegetarians and 70% of vegans https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201412/84-vegetarians-and-vegans-return-meat-why, http://thesurge.com/stories/heres-why-84-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-return-to-eating-meat.) Yes, there are many reasons why this is, including social pressures, people going through phases, bad diets, different dietary needs and (my personal favorite) people just not wanting to be associated with nasty, vile and breathtakingly stuck up vegans with anger management issues (which may or may not apply to you personally, but it fucking well does for a lot of vegans online....like Vegan Gaines.) But bottom line: there are more ex-vegans than there are vegans.  Finally (and yes, I mean FINALLY as I know better than to get drawn into a one-sided, militant ideologist, vegan or otherwise) I am so glad that you, Vegan Gaines and other like minded kids don't speak for all vegans. ""BUT I NEVER SAID I DID"" No, but you act as though you do. In my travels into the vegan crowd, I have had the pleasure of finding people who are vegan but are not so absolutist in their views. Yes, they will tell you what they think in the interest of having an open discussion. I find it refreshing how many people I've found who stick to their principles on veganism, but are more willing to things like ""compromise"" and ""dissent."" You say you're ""not sugarcoating things."" No. You're merely parroting points made by others.",6,2017-04-30T02:16:55.000Z,0.06666615353040001,0.548674055829,en,psychologytoday,"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201412/84-vegetarians-and-vegans-return-meat-why,",True,False

In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. However, since sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place in the first two months of pregnancy and sexual differentiation of the brain starts in the second half of pregnancy, these two processes can be influenced independently, which may result in transsexuality. This also means that in the event of ambiguous sex at birth, the degree of masculinization of the genitals may not reflect the degree of masculinization of the brain. There is no proof that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.""   From the 3rd  ""At the Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria in Amsterdam, the current treatment protocol allows adolescents diagnosed with GD that persisted from childhood into adolescence to start treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) from the age of 12 years, to suppress endogenous gonadal stimulation and thus the development of irreversible sex characteristics of the natal sex (36). From the age of 16 years on, as a first step in sex reassignment they receive cross-sex hormone treatment, i.e., biological boys receive estrogens and biological girls receive androgens""  From the 4th  ""Increasingly, biomedical research is implicating biological factors. Co-occurrence among twin pairs, father-son pairs, and brother-sister pairs (7,8) raises the question of whether gender dysphoria is heritable. Anatomical studies show that certain brain structures in male-to-female transsexuals are more “female-like” in volume and neuronal density (9,10). Furthermore, the re- sponse to the odor of male and female steroids in male-to-female transsexuals was more similar to that of control women than control men (11).""  From the 1st  ""Other investigators have looked at sex differences through brain functioning. In a study published in 2014, psychologist Sarah M. Burke of VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam and biologist Julie Bakker of the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience used functional MRI to examine how 39 prepubertal and 41 adolescent boys and girls with gender dysphoria responded to androstadienone, an odorous steroid with pheromonelike properties that is known to cause a different response in the hypothalamus of men versus women. They found that the adolescent boys and girls with gender dysphoria responded much like peers of their experienced gender. The results were less clear with the prepubertal children. This kind of study is important, says Baudewijntje Kreukels, an expert on gender dysphoria at VU University Medical Center, “because sex differences in responding to odors cannot be influenced by training or environment.” The same can be said of another 2014 experiment by Burke and her colleagues. They measured the responses of boys and girls with gender dysphoria to echolike sounds produced by the inner ear in response to a clicking noise. Boys with gender dysphoria responded more like typical females, who have a stronger response to these sounds. But girls with gender dysphoria also responded like typical females.""   Of course these studies are inconclusive but this and the fact that medication given to psychotic patients doesn't work to relieve them of their ""delusions"" makes it very clear that it is not a form of psychosis. I think these studies prove that.

The poor Y chromosome is also at a disadvantage because it is in the testis every generation. This is a dangerous place to be because cells must divide many times to make sperm, so mutations are much more frequent.""   http://theconversation.com/sex-genes-the-y-chromosome-and-the-future-of-men-32893",0,2018-01-12T18:04:41.000Z,0.0635416666667,0.534375,en,theconversation,http://theconversation.com/sex-genes-the-y-chromosome-and-the-future-of-men-32893,False,False

Obesity is very complicated. There are many factors that can lead a person to obesity and depending on genetics, it can determine how easy or difficult it is remove fat.  ""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-people-become-overweight""  ""and if the stereotypes that's women are less masculine are true then it isn't a bias towards gender but a bias towards competitiveness"" It is wrong to presume that women are not capable of being competitive due to stereotypes. Well there are some stereotypes that are scientifically accurate, others like competitiveness are not. In fact women can even be more competitive than men. Not only that but cooperation ( a feminine trait) can benefit business more than competitiveness, as it help motivate employees, creates long lasting relationships with suppliers and with other companies that are part of a joint venture.   http://woman.thenest.com/importance-cooperation-workplace-14647.html  http://www.evancarmichael.com/library/lynn-dorman-phd-jd/Cooperation-vs-Competition-in-Todays-Business.html (ignore video and scroll down to actual article).  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/six-stereotypes-about-men-and-women-that-are-scientifically-true/  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167294201003  ""but you just said women aren't suitable for business, it isn't just a stereotype that man are more masculine, it's a fact. That's means more men are going to have the qualities needed compared to women."" I never said that. All I said was the directors presume that women are not able to compete in the business environment, which is completely false.  ""being a full time parent is just as important as being a worker and women are valued more as parents so there is something that women are strongly valued more in."" Yes it is but that's the only thing that women are valued for. In a society where everyone is equal people should be able to pursue any career without the influence of any social pressure based on their race and gender.  ""And who's to say these women have problems, half the stuff famous women say about problems with women never even applied to them."" And why do you presume that it hasn't through? Oh because they are famous? Well that fallacious because being famous does not mean that one has not faced hardships or obstacles based on their race or gender.  ""And you just proved that society is against men, it's hard to feel sympathy for a man. Men are always told to be the more evil one and that women have to be careful of evil men and it looks like you fell for it."" It's hard to feel sympathy because don't have much of a real disadvantage in society.  ""Men are always told to be the more evil one and that women have to be careful of evil men and it looks like you fell for it."" That's complete horseshit. No one is saying ""men are evil."" If you actual researched and talked to people who actual study this subject instead of listening to people who constantly like to misrepresent them then you wouldn't say something so ignorant.  ""even women that live in femisnts countries in Europe don't want to go into a high payed job. Most women that complain about not enough women in business would never have wanted to go in them selves. If we still need to motivate women away from the more extreme western cultures then i think it says that women aren't cut out for and don't want to be in business. If we need to motivate women that much then that goes back to saying they aren't usually competitive enough which then means they are less likely to be as good at the job and less likely to get hired or a pay rise. Women's attitude in the workplace is usually different to men's as they are more likely to see it in a negative light so they wouldn't be working to as high of a standard as they need. Men usually enjoy work more and are motivated to doing it so.""  This is by far the most dumbest part of your comment I have seen. There are many factors that push women away from achieving high role positions, such as gender stereotypes, household responsibility, the way in which they are mentored, and the lack of role models. The reason we need to encourage more women into higher positions is because society has for the most part been pushing women away.",0,2017-09-11T12:53:39.000Z,0.0730599046016,0.548108024691,en,harvard.edu,"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-people-become-overweight""",False,False

North America’s oldest mummy returned to US tribe after genome sequencing  DNA proves Native American roots of 10,600-year-old skeleton.  http://www.nature.com/news/north-america-s-oldest-mummy-returned-to-us-tribe-after-genome-sequencing-1.21108  In October 2015, Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary geneticist who specializes in ancient DNA analysis at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, travelled to Nevada to collect bone and tooth samples from the mummy and other remains for DNA sequencing, after meeting with tribe members several months earlier.  Willerslev’s team concluded that the Spirit Cave remains are more closely related to indigenous groups in North and South America than to any other contemporary population. The BLM gave Nature a preliminary scientific report from the team, and a 31-page memo outlining its reasoning for repatriating the remains. Willerslev declined to comment because his team’s data have not yet been published in a journal. Hockett says the genome findings offered the only unequivocal evidence that the remains are Native American. No evidence links the remains to any specific group — not even the ancient DNA",1,2017-04-05T03:54:25.000Z,0.0628205128205,0.295512820513,en,nature_news,http://www.nature.com/news/north-america-s-oldest-mummy-returned-to-us-tribe-after-genome-sequencing-1.21108,True,False

It plays a large role.* Still doesn't have relevance to how doctors treat patients  *It isn't that simple though. I agree that insurance companies shouldn't be dropping people, but why are they doing that? To me the reason why is because the people have essentially no control over their insurance companies. The reason for that is because they mainly get it through their employer. And the reason for that is because of the payroll tax.* It is very simple, if you give the private market people to do that then you can do that because unfortunately they will raise cost if they are forced to take people who get sick. It isn't difficult to understand but you keep dodging the issues, other healthcares don't have this issue which is what people in the medical field want.  ""Bernie sanders plan did not matter, because it was a tax estimate that other economists disputed, but the point is to cover everyone equally and not allow people to get sick and die without coverage. That's the problem you don't understand, you are looking at patients from a $$$ point of view which you can't. You should never do that because you are trying to justify people dying but putting a $$$ on them and that you cannot do in the medical field, again something you know nothing about has no role here.""  *The economy is more than just dollars. It is about goods and services. Bernie wants to cover everyone equally, the reality is that we lack doctors, nurses, surgeons, researchers and so on in the industry. We lack skilled workers to provide healthcare to all without lowering the quality. Also, you have to consider the fact that you will be giving people care in an order as opposed to giving care to people who are more productive in society. For example, say I need a knee surgery. I have insurance and can get it and doing so will get me back to work where I am productive to society and produce wealth. But say I have to wait while someone who is not productive nor has a job gets care in front of me? Now I am our of commission which limits my productivity. There is a reason why the US beats several countries in productivity as well. So there is that side to it as well. Economics is not just about dollars, but in your simplistic mind it is.* You don't seem to understand the saying, when I mean it is dollars I mean you are essentially sending people to death because in your mind, they aren't productive. Which is exactly what you just said and sorry to break it to you, *it doesn't work like that anyways in this country anyways*. The code ethics of doctors taking the oaf do not allow you to prioritize patients on a list for reasons such as financial. Now you may be bribed which will get you barred if you are caught, but you only prioritize certain issues such as age because if you have to choose between an older or younger person for a transplant, you go with the younger person assuming most things are equal. Saying that people should essentially die because you think you are more productive really speaks value of the kind of piece of crap you really are. I truly hope you get sick and I truly hope you lose coverage and understand how terrible the US system really was.   *Larger classes means lower quality of education meaning lower quality of doctors. We lack professors, TAs, tutors, dorms, classrooms, equipment and so on in universities to offer education to people. And go to med school is highly stressful as is. I teach at a university and as a PhD student I have live with the stress and it does not compare to that in the medical field. Not many people can do it or are willing to do it. Also, under Bernie he wants to guarantee* *1. a living wage* *2. paternity leave* *3. sick days *4. vacation time* *5. healthcare* *6. retirement*  *And so on to anyone working. So where is the incentive to become a doctor? This isn't a situation of you building it and they will come. It is stressful to do that job.* This is why I say over and over and over again to *stay out of the field you don't know anything about*. Do you know how many people are accepted per year? Around 120-200 out of 5000+ applications usually, I'll give an example. The class I was accepted too was around 120 out of 6500 applications, so they only took around 2% of the applications. Not only would tons of people jump at the oppertunity to get in, but many people are extremely qualified but it's become so competitive, even with an MCAT of a 511, you struggle to get interviews in many allopathic schools and need a score of around 506 to get interviews to osteopathic schools.   *I doubt you have experience in the field because if you did you will see it is much more complicated than just opening more schools and then magically more doctors appear. And I rather not wait that long as I will be out of commission, same with other productive workers.* You are a moron, of course I know about it because I am in the field and they are already doing this as they speak. They are opening allopathic and osteopathic schools every year attempting to keep up with the influx of doctors they have to pump out, the difference is they need to educate more doctors. This issue is happening right now in the country, the only difference is they need to keep up with them. No magically doctors won't show up, but the reality is many people are highly qualified but are turned down due to the massive amounts of people. People with MCATS as high as (510ish)80th percentile at times are finding issues trying to get into medical schools that are allopathic. Even new medical schools open try to shoot around that mark, not speaking of established schools.  "" Again he is assuming this point without any actual empirical evidence, it's just a claim he makes randomly in the study attempting to  *I am not rejecting the pre-existing conditions. It is a problem, but why? To me it comes back to people getting insurance through their employer as opposed to getting it at a young age on their own. And you say you have knowledge in the field which I highly doubt. If you did you will realize that we can't just open more colleges and than doctors will appear. I failed a handful of students wanting to attend nursing school because they simply could not handle the work. And I work hard as an educator trying to get them to understand physics. I always get great reviews as an instructor, the students just couldn't get it.* Same argument as I posted above, actually I'll repost it  They are already doing opening news school every year. They are opening allopathic and osteopathic schools every year attempting to keep up with the influx of doctors they have to pump out, the difference is they need to educate more doctors. This issue is happening right now in the country, the only difference is they need to keep up with them. No magically doctors won't show up, but the reality is many people are highly qualified but are turned down due to the massive amounts of people. People with MCATS as high as (510ish)80th percentile at times are finding issues trying to get into medical schools that are allopathic. Even new medical schools open try to shoot around that mark, not speaking of established schools.  *Again, you missed the point. He is showing how sensitive the data related to healthcare is and how minor changes can lead to the numbers being ranked in a different order. That shows the differences in healthcare quality with those countries is so minute that you can't make the claim that they are doing it better. You can do a statistical analysis showing the US is terrible and on can do a statistical analysis that is just as legit to show the US is the best.* Again it isn't the best if a doctor cannot dictate what treatment you get, its so shocking that *you do not understand this*.  *And Prof. Oshfeldt even said that other issues such as diet and exercising and smoking play a role. None of those require healthcare but basic knowledge that proper dieting and exercising is good for your health and smoking isn't. And I do feel preventative care is good, but this brings up the point of why do we have to rely on insurance for that? Why can't we just pay out of pocket?* What happens if you can't afford it out of pocket? What if something more serious is found? Then what do you do? Pray?  *You say that but you haven't given any reason why you feel that way besides plausible situations. You haven't shown anything that preventative care can actually lower healthcare costs or improve the quality. I feel many people go to the hospital for asinine reasons. I had a manager who weighed over 500 pounds and every doctor told her what I told her, that she needed to change her diet and lose weight. That doesn't take a doctor to say that, but she took time away from doctors. If you are going to make accusations you have to back them up. So far you haven't.* http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735245 http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/9/1656.full Of course it saves lives, the argument you keep posing is financially which doesn't matter really to us in the medical field. The fact that you are arguing that it can lower healthcost is ridiculous, I am arguing it saves lives, that is what matters in healthcare. It isn't ""Wait does it cost more or less"", and again if you have no idea whats wrong with her why comment? She may have a hypothyroid that causes weight gain. She may have a far slower metabolism that burns fat far slower than most people. She may have multiple issues, but heres the prime point If I am the doctor and I say X, Y and Z, an idiot like you should have no input in what she gets *since you have no experience in the field* and that should *never* be disputed.",3,2017-02-09T05:03:11.000Z,0.032276310564900004,0.476994005249,en,medscape,http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735245,False,False

He said that women suffered more as society tends to favour men over women.  Alexander Hamelton  Your idea that a patriarchy can't exist if men suffer as well shows you don't know much about history then. Most of the discrimination that men face comes from ideas that have benefited them as well. For instance, men are seen as more competitive and assertive which is often associated with good leadership, which gives them the advantage over women in terms of receiving higher leadership position. But this idea has also disadvantaged men in courtrooms which is why often receive longer sentences. And the problem here is that people, in general, do hold particular beliefs and bias about another group, which does place them either at an advantage or disadvantage.  Nip Drip  ""Men are significantly more likely to be killed on the job, work a disgusting job, be murdered or become the victim of violent crimes, live on the street, and are the only gender capable of being drafted.""  All that was true way before women were given the rights to vote, yet we wouldn't say that a patriarchy didn't exist back. Also, a factor for this is that men are often taught to suppress their emotions and are encouraged to be violent.  http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/violence-against-women-1959171-Feb2015/  ""women are over-represented in college (yet  affirmative action and women only scholarships still exist),""  Yet are still underrepresented in STEM courses.  ""control most of the disposable income,""  But women still earn less then men and hold little representation in high company positions.   ""are overrepresented amongst voters,""  Yet are underrepresented in government positions.  ""are significantly more likely to receive attention for diseases that affect their gender despite the fact that prostate cancer affects men at a similar rate as breast cancer affects women,""  I found an article that addresses this topic:  https://katatrepsis.com/2012/10/30/why-does-breast-cancer-research-receive-more-research-funding-than-prostate-cancer/  ""are favoured in child custody cases,""  I have an article that talks about this as well but in summery, the reason women receive the child is that they are often placed in positions that make them more favourable.  https://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time  ""marry up the socioeconomic status while being responsible for 80% of divorces,""  And I have two articles on this topic.  http://time.com/money/4630251/the-modern-marriage-trap-and-what-to-do-about-it/  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-resilience/201508/women-initiate-divorce-much-more-men-heres-why  ""and can take a large sum of their husband’s income after the divorce (practically an incentive to divorce).""  This law is not directed at men but towards the partner who makes the largest income. Women can and have also been affected by this as well but it's not very common as men are still the biggest earners.  ""Young women are even beginning to out earn young men in some of America’s largest cities when accounting for a variety of confounding factors.""  But women in general (especially mothers) still underearn then men.  ""Any issue women raise is deadly serious, and yet nobody cares to address or even acknowledge any of the problems that affect men, meaning that women will continue to be taken care of while the situation of men will only likely worsen.""  How would it worsen? Most of the issues that men face are due to the patriarchal culture. If we remove this culture then a lot of the problems that men face would disappear as well.",0,2018-03-16T16:42:59.000Z,0.0931442007605,0.556857057671,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-resilience/201508/women-initiate-divorce-much-more-men-heres-why,False,False

Our teeth are another great example that we did not evolve to eat such high amounts of meat.

Louis Pasteur never once addressed abiogenesis and I challenge you to cite him doing so.  --  You wrote - ""'The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable with the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein. ' -Sir Fred Hoyle FRS.""  Great. Please cite how he calculated those chances.  --  You quoted - ""7 Theories on the Origin of Life - Live Science https://www.livescience.com › Strange News""  I wonder. Did you ever actually go to the sources for each of those theories? You would be surprised to discover that, whether or not any of them are how life started, they actually are backed by experiments that have confirmed their predictions.  How many discoveries have ever been made by testing a hypothesis derrived from assuming a creation event?  I have already asked you this and you have refused to answer. I am showing you the courtesy of responding to you practically line-by-line. I don't expect you to do the same, but you can, at least, show me the courtesy of answering my direct questions and refraining from your consistent equivocations of abiogenesis and spontaneous generation without, at least presenting your reason for doing so.  --  You cited - Newsweek, Khan Academy, Study dot com, BBC,  and Smashing Lists.  NONE of them discuss abiogenesis as fact and neither, I suspect, does your grandson's teacher.  --  You wrote - ""Apart from the fact that the hacks/wordsmiths mentioned in the articles above are largely paid by the State to advocate their State approved theories/speculations/hypotheses and guesswork""  Please present the financials you must have compiled to make that assertion.  --  You wrote - ""what's the actual difference between their 'theories' and my own Mr Reed ?""  Their theories have real-world applications and make testable & falsifiable predictions.  I've asked you multiple times to present the real-world applications and testable & falsifiable predictions of your assertions and you've repeatedly ignored me. I have one rule on my channel. I insist that you present primary sources for any assertions you make when asked. You have yet to produce one single primary source.  So unfortunately, in the interest of not wasting time, I am forced to give you this last warning. If your next post doesn't present a rationale for equivocating abiogenesis and spontaneous generation or doesn't present a real-world application for your ""theory"" (or, at least, a concession that you don't have one), it will be your last post on my channel ever.  I am always willing to present references for anything I assert and I must insist that I be given the same intellectual respect. Otherwise, you are wasting my time.  --  You wrote - ""Ironically,  my own 'theory/best guess/hypothesis' that Life was originally seeded (for whatever reason ? ) here on Earth by highly advanced Extra-terrestrials, is based on the easily verifiable fact that (allowing for the archaic literary terms used) the Genesis Creation Account is a virtual mirror image of NASA's current plans on how the terraformation of Mars might be attempted.""  Great. How do you test that theory?  --  You wrote - ""By direct contrast,  the current dogma being advocated by the Evolutionary 'Consensus' seriously suggests that if enough muddy ponds/puddles are watched for long enough...the molecular organism capable of becoming the grandad to all life on Earth will eventually be spontaneously generated into existence, and begin growing legs/eyes/fins/wings etc.""  1. No. Scientists never claimed that life originated in a muddy pond. I challenge you to cite even one scientific paper which ever claimed such a thing. 2. No. Scientists do not claim anything occurred spontaneously.

I never ceases to amaze me how many people spout quotes without ever having read their own source. 1. The complete quote is, ""Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the sentiment of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless condition. It is the opium of the people."" Do you comprehend what that means? 2. I'll give you a hint, when that statement was made, opium was a medication used to quelle suffering.  --  You quoted Marx - “Communism begins where atheism begins.”  So, shall I associate ALL christians with the creationists who picket the funerals of soldiers, or would you agree that I would be making a compositional fallacy?  --  You wrote - """"There can be no doubt about the fact that the founding ideological principle that Communist Party members cannot be religious believers has been upheld by our party from the ...""  1.

It certainly is, in the short term, but when the environment changes, any changes in the organism can also be a detriment. The fossil record, and modern history, is replete with organisms which were well-adapted to their local environment but were unprepared when the ecology changed. This is where the word, ""immediate"" applies.     --     You wrote - ""Remember your base claim you seem to be supporting that gene mutation and natural selection can provide new species over time with new info I would call that an improvement.""     New species. No.  Speciation. Yes.  If you don't know the difference you have no business commenting.  And no, speciation is not necessarily an improvement.     --     You wrote - ""Bigger and stronger is a plus when you are a hunter/gatherer.""     1. Depends on what you're hunting or gathering.  2.

Neanderthal had a bigger, yet inferior brain, so again, bigger is not always better.  2. Neanderthals, themselves were shorter and squatter than modern humans.

What is a ""higher goal"" in the interest of survival? Fitness is about reproductive viability. You may notice that the stereotypical Walmart customer seems to be rather successful at reproducing.  The products available at WalMart are inexpensive, requiring less to acquire. A stereotypical WalMart customer (Emphasis on the word, ""Stereotypical"") has no need to work any harder for food or necessities.

Most of the calories livestock animals consume is used up for things like maintaining homeostasis or standing about. That is why it takes approximately 16lbs of grain to produce 1lb of beef. I'll link to you some sources if you are interested in learning more.  In regards to what we would do about the animals, that likely wouldn't be a concern. The only reason all these animals are being bred, is because of consumer demand for animal products. A shift to veganism would be a gradual one, meaning the consumer demand will also decline gradually.

Ambos são seres sencientes que buscam o prazer, evitar sofrimento e preservar sua própria vida e integridade. Faz todo sentido comparar a opressão que humanos e outros animais sofrem. Ambos não querem ter seus interesses violados. A opressão é a mesma, o que muda são as vitimas.  Os outros animais não agem meramente por instinto.  A crença de que animais agem meramente por instinto não procede, porque no que diz respeito às sentimentos e emoções, eles agem exatamente como os seres humanos. Perceber o sofrimento como negativo e o prazer como positivo não é algo exclusivo de humanos.   Como os estudos de Charles Darwin mostram, a racionalidade tambem está presente tambem nos outros animais. Não no mesmo grau que as pessoas humanas sãs, mas tem. Não existem características unicamente humanas. As diferenças entre humanos e demais animais são de cunho quantitativo e não qualitativo. Naquilo que une o homem aos demais animais, os estudos de Darwin mostram que não há diferenças de natureza, mas sim de grau. As habilidades, os instintos, a inteligencia, a capacidade de comunicação (linguagem), os comportamentos, são caracteres animais difundidos por uma infinidade de especies.   “não há diferenças fundamentais entre o homem e os animais nas suas faculdades mentais"". DARWIN, Charles. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, v.1, 1871, p. 35-39  Olha, o que eu fiz foi citar a conclusão do estudo de Darwin. Eu não estou validando um argumento pelo fato de que Darwin falou. Eu estou validando o argumento pela EVIDENCIA demonstrada. Então eu pergunto, onde no estudo de Darwin houve erro metodologico? Houve algum dado fraudulento fabricado no estudo por Darwin? Onde estão os artigos cientificos refutando essa conclusão de Darwin? Se vc não aceita a conclusão demonstrada por Darwin, ok, mas ao menos deixa claro que vc faz por motivos religiosos, e não por motivos lógicos.  De acordo com nossa melhor ciência: A diferença de racionalidade entre um adulto e um bebê é de grau.  A diferença de racionalidade entre um deficiente mental e uma pessoa sã é de grau. Assim como é a diferença da racionalidade de um humano e um animal não-humano é de grau.  Alguem discorda? Refute Darwin então. E nossa melhor ciência só CORROBORA com a conclusão de Darwin.   A comunidade cientifica declara que animais são auto-conscientes. Diversos neuro-cientistas por meio da Declaração da Consciência de Cambridge, relataram a auto-consciencia dos animais devido a avalanche de evidências científicas que vêm sendo acumuladas ao longo das últimas décadas.  A Declaração de Cambridge, de tão aceita no meio acadêmico, já até ecoou no Brasil, através da Declaração de Curitiba, que, firmada no 3º Congresso Brasileiro de Bioética e Bem-estar Animal, sob a chancela do Conselho Federal de Medicina Veterinária.  As evidências científicas que comprovam o teor dessa publicação se dividem em quatro categorias: comportamentais, neurológicas, farmacológicas e evolutivas. Elas mostram que os animais se comportam como seres humanos, além de apresentarem estrutura nervosa semelhante à do homem. Por exemplo: algumas das substâncias liberadas diante de sensações de medo, ansiedade e alegria nos seres humanos também estão presentes nos animais.  No maior congresso de ciencia do mundo: AAAS, cientistas apresentaram as evidencias de nossas semelhanças com os outros animais e concluiram que não faz sentido eles serem excluidos da comunidade moral.  De acordo com os estudos do biologo Richard Dawkins: “Não há nenhuma categoria natural que inclua chimpazés, gorilas e orangotangos, mas que exclua humanos."" DAWKINS, R. Gaps in the mind. In: CAVALIERI, P.; SINGER, P. (Eds.). The great ape project: equality beyond humanity. New York> Martin's Griffin, 1993 P. 80-88.

Os animais podem constantemente ser vistos ao parar, deliberar e resolver. É um fato significativo o de que quanto mais os hábitos de um animal particular são estudados por um naturalista, mais ele os atribui à razão e menos a instintos inatos ""  Darwin, em A ascendência do homem, parte da admissão fundamental de que homens e animais compartilham uma série de instintos naturais, e também a capacidade de aprender e, por isso, modificar seu comportamento a partir da experiência adquirida.   A inteligência, ou as faculdades mentais do homem, assemelham-se às dos animais superiores, proibindo qualquer atribuição de um lugar privilegiado do ser humano por causa delas.  Darwin enumera uma série de poderes ou faculdades mentais de que o ser humano é dotado, e que os animais [compartilham] com ele, em maior ou menor grau. Entre eles encontram-se a capacidade de imitação, a curiosidade e a imaginação. Mas possivelmente, as observações mais interessantes de Darwin sejam dirigidas ao que ele denomina com o termo ""razão"". Conforme suas palavras: ""de todas as faculdades da mente humana, será, eu presumo, admitido que a razão encontra-se no topo. Apenas poucas pessoas atualmente disputam que os animais possuem algum poder de raciocínio""  Assim, do ponto de vista do que é relevante para um epistemólogo, Darwin considera a razão como um resultado da seleção natural, cuja ocorrência pode ser constatada em sua expressão máxima no ser humano, mas que também se encontra em outros animais. Pode-se aqui definir, em linhas bastante gerais, a razão, como uma capacidade de lidar com idéias, tirar conclusões e, como resultado, manifestar conhecimento acerca do ambiente e de suas regularidades.

The news article I found from Nature ( http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050711/full/news050711-12.html ) states that the authors claim to be date individual cells within +- 2 years.  Some very simple math can tell us that these authors are lying through their teeth.  Human genome has 3.25 billion base pairs per genome, 2 genomes per somatic cell,  2 nucleotides per base pair, and 10 atoms or less of carbon atoms per nucleotide.  Multiplying all of those numbers together give us 1.3E11 carbon atoms in the DNA of one cell.  Carbon-14 exists at the level of 1 to 1.5 atoms of carbon-14 per 1E12 carbon atoms.  This means that you would need more than 5 cells worth of DNA to get on average just ONE atom of carbon-14. (You need several thousand or more C-14 atoms to date an object.)  Which means that it is absolutely 100% impossible to date an individual cell based on radiocarbon dating said cell's DNA.    Now to address your point that a group of cells could be counted instead.  Cells can be separated by flow cytometry, magnetic cell sorting, and other methods, however, these cells are usually LIVE spherical cells that lend themselves to those sorting techniques.  Neurons that aren't raised in petri dishes aren't spherical, and once these cells die they will be very unlikely to be able to become spherical, which would make cell sorting much, much more difficult. (sorting by hand would take a ridiculous amount of time.)  Since glial cells outnumber neurons anywhere from 10-50:1, you would be very likely to include many glial cells in your ""sorted"" sample, since sorting is far from perfect, especially on dead non-spherical cells.  The inclusion of these cells would make any data you found nearly worthless since they would include relatively ""young"" DNA.     Secondly, even though any biology student can do a DNA prep, that doesn't mean that the DNA is very pure.  For this application you would need nearly perfectly pure DNA, because, once again, the DNA carbon in a cell is VASTLY outnumbered by the carbon from lipids, proteins, and RNA.  These contaminants are generally acceptable for PCR, gels, and other assays, but could obviously massively throw off the results of a radiocarbon dating test.  The DNA can be purified further using techniques that go beyond the basic DNA prep, but the question is can you really purify it to the point where you are ONLY dating the DNA from those cells that you want.  (Especially when the carbon in the gels, ethanol, and other purification tools can also contaminate your sample, not to mention Carbon from CO2, dust, etc. from the air.)    When you are talking about trying to tell a difference of a factor of 2 or less in biology, you are very unlikely to get accurate results, especially when you are testing small samples. (When I was doing research I would say that any difference less than an order of magnitude possibly wasn't real, especially for small sample sizes.)  Radiocarbon dating is also inherently inaccurate, partly due to the presence of carbon quite literally everywhere.  A quick search found this article, http://www.chem.uwec.edu/Chem115_F00/nelsolar/chem.htm which states: ""There are also some tests that have been done that don’t quite match up. For instance, bones of a sabre-toothed tiger, theorized to be between 100,000 and one million years old, gave a Carbon date of 28,000 years. A freshly killed seal, dated using Carbon-14, showed it had died 1300 years ago. Living mollusk shells were dated at up to 2,300 years old. Some very unusual evidence is that living snails' shells showed that they had died 27,000 years ago. (Ham, Snelling, & Wieland)""  So I don't buy that these scientists can date living tissue to +-2 years with radiocarbon dating, and truly I think it is a great example of Junk Science.",2,2016-06-04T19:13:11.000Z,-0.0114990981241,0.5655853174600001,en,nature_news,http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050711/full/news050711-12.html,False,False

D level is often included now on routine laboratory blood panels. These are much less expensive to order than even a small number of the constituent tests individually. So, the physician then may have a patient with an ""abnormal"" vit D level and scant evidence of exactly what to do, if anything, about the data.  The urge is always to do something...anything. Perhaps the appropriate reaction would be to search for those diseases which may be associated with low vit D or other fat-soluble vit levels. In stead, and much more often, I suspect, the reaction is just to prescribe vit. D3. I am not aware that giving vit D, D2 or D3 to people whose levels are ""low"" produces any benefit.  Perhaps...perhaps some otherwise healthy old people who take vit D fall less often though I don't think anyone has demonstrated increased muscle strength or improved balance in those populations. It is highly unlikely that low vit D level would be the only obvious manifestation of a particular disease process and prompt further investigation, but it's possible.  Nonetheless,  I think that's the direction a lab. observation of a low level should take.  I asked my own physician (Hopkins graduate, certified by 3 boards) whether the sole abnormality of a low D level on a lab slip led him to an otherwise undiagnosed disease.  He could recall none.  Do you recommend supplementation in otherwise healthy pts. with low levels...""sometimes"". I asked why and he said that he was aware of no objective data to guide the decision but it reduced patient anxiety about the ""abnormality"" and seemed harmless, if calcium and phosphate levels were normal and remained so.

Where's the science?  My problem with this episode is that it's full of opinions unchecked by the scientific facts. For example, at 1:00 we have a just-so story about why native peoples resist engagement with the outside world. This story isn't backed up by any evidence or argument. It's probably mostly wrong. Native peoples probably have very complex, traditional and personal reasons for not engaging with the outside world. Many are simply too geographically isolated for us to expect they have any concept of the outside world. Throughout history, people have fled traditional lifestyles to move into the cities. This is just one example from a three-minute video somehow packed with a Gish Gallop of ideological bullshit, free of any contamination from reality. The ""references"" in the video description do not back up this claim at 1:00 or many other dubious claims in the video. That's unbecoming of this channel.  To expand on my original post, I count:  * 21 separate statements. * 9 non-factual or pseudo-factual statements (8 opinions and 1 joke). * 12 strictly factual claims. * 4 claims which are demonstrably false or contradicted by one or more of the ""references"". * 8 claims which might be true but are not supported in any of the ""references"". Excluding those which I find uncontroversially true. * 5 claims which are misleading or non-sequitur. * 3 downright unscientific statements.  The last 4 numbers should all be zero. I feel like this is not too much to ask. Even from this channel given their short video lengths.  0:00 ""First contacts area always exciting but they rarely go smoothly."" Opinion. Almost a claim but unquantified and so too vague and subjective.  0:06 ""In Star Trek, the crew of the enterprise continually encounters new civilizations that want to attack, assimilate, or worship it."" Opinion. Interpretation of a fictional television show.  0:13 ""And in reality, most first contacts have been downright disastrous."" Claim not backed up by qualitative comparative analysis in any of the ""references"". Non-sequitur because how things went in the past alone isn't sufficient to predict how things will go in the future. Things have changed since colonialism.  0:18 ""When European explorers came to the Americas, they brought novel diseases, guns, and colonialism with them."" Facts! Uncontroversial but irrelevant ones because small pox is eradicated and we're not talking about shooting or colonizing uncontacted peoples.  0:25 ""And ended up killing over 50 million Native Americans."" Incorrect, historically revisionist fact. This number is greatly exaggerated by any honest reading of history. Not supported in any of the ""references"". Also irrelevant because most of the deaths were from small pox which has since been irradiated. Also colonialism is non-sequitur to the question of humanitarian contact with native peoples.  0:28 ""Steamrolling this culture and stealing their land."" Guilt-mongering. I count this an opinion masquerading as a fact which is unsubstantiated, misleading, and downright unscientific.  0:31 ""Today, we're nearing the end of first contacts on Earth. Where dense tropical rainforests are home to the last 100 or so groups of isolated peoples."" Finally! A true and relevant fact!  0:40 ""The remote areas where isolated groups live are increasingly trafficked by drug runners, exploited by logging and mining companies, and invaded by missionaries, tourists, and settlers."" Factual claim of an increasing trend not supported by qualitative comparative analysis in any of the ""references"".  0:50 ""Not only do these intrusions result in violent encounters, loss of land and resources, and alterations to the cultures and ways of life of isolated groups."" Vague claims but I'll grant they're logical consequences of the factual claim at 0:40. But since that claim was unsubstantiated, this claim falls under the same category.  1:00 ""They also bring diseases likely to kill half the members of those groups."" Quantitative claim not found in any of the ""references"". One reference says ""up to half"" [1] which is not the same as ""half"". It's statistically bankrupt to draw this conclusion based on one tragic event, especially given the reporting of the event isn't a scientific paper, but an activist group's website [2]. I'm calling this claim worse than unsubstantiated. It's downright unscientific.  1:04 ""In fact, these kinds of negative outcomes have lead many isolated peoples to resist further engagement with the outside world."" Factual claim not backed up by qualitative comparative analysis in any of the ""references"". In fact, one paper [3] contradicts this hypothesis in reporting a tribe choosing ""engagement with the outside world"" as a direct consequence of ""these kinds of negative outcomes"". Providing references which on examination refute one's claims is profoundly intellectually dishonest so I'm calling this one downright unscientific, too.  1:11 ""But unlike the crew of the Enterprise, with their prime directive to avoid engaging alien civilizations, unless they initiate contact, ..."" Opinion. More fictional interpretation of a television show.  1:19 ""Earthlings have no consistent protocol for how to avoid and manage contact with isolated groups."" I searched around. As far as I can tell this is an uncontroversial, true, and relevant fact.  1:24 ""Some countries have given legal recognition to these groups right to be left alone, even crating no trespass reserves to protect them and their lands from intrusion."" True and relevant fact.  1:32 ""But those same governments haven't actually provided the funds and support necessary to enforce their own policies."" Political opinion masquerading as a factual claim. It's also an example of the nirvana fallacy and therefore not strictly relevant. No matter how many guards FUNAI posts [4], people will sneak by.  1:38 ""What's more, some governments have explicitly violated their own laws by letting energy companies drill within their reserves."" Political opinion masquerading as a factual claim. Wrong because governments can create legal exceptions to existing laws. That's how laws work. Too vague to be found in any of the ""references"".  1:46 ""All of this makes resistance seem futile."" This is a joke.  1:49 ""If we don't come up with some kind of plan, our history of disastrous first contacts is bound to repeat its self with each of the remaining isolated groups on this planet."" Speculation not predicted scientifically in any of the ""references"".  1:58 ""The pragmatic response would be to violate their autonomy in a less bad way..."" Opinion.  2:14 ""... or, we could ... stay away, all of us, from where isolated people's live. Until they decide to make first contact.""

It has been predicted for black holes and confirmed by the GPS satellites in the gravity well of earth itself. The signals used by GPS are required to be adjusted to account for time dilation caused by the difference in the gravity well between the orbit of the satellites and the GPS units on the ground. This adjustment is very tiny due to the very small gravity well created by the mass of the earth and the very close orbit of the satellites.  This time dilation is a repeatable and verifiable fact one cannot deny. And would apply just as well in all of the known universe, including the vast emptiness found in-between the galaxies.  As mass increases time slows down.  The gravity well produced by an entire galaxy containing billions of stars, planets and even black holes will be far larger by factors in the billions then that of just the earth. The difference in the flow of time one would experience at the center of a galaxy would be immensely slower then that witch would be found outside of its gravity well in the intergalactic space in-between the galaxies.  If time is slower inside of the galaxies, then it would be faster outside the galaxies.

Not entirely true, but not entirely false. The number is based on how many humans we calculate have ever lived, what kinds of conditions the vast majority of them lived in, the high mortality rates among children for most human history, and the current rates of mortality because of malaria among countries still living in similar conditions. When you crunch the numbers you get about 1 in 2 people who have lived dying from it, but in all likelihood the ""real"" percentage would be different if you did the numbers more thoroughly (which is nearly impossible due to the lack of historical records going far enough into the past).

What??  I believe your motivation behind making this video was somewhat pure? But I don't think you quite hit the mark..  First some general problems with the videos logic and information.  You imply several causal correlations without any evidence. I know it is tempting to infer causation from correlation but it is wrong.  A similar error arises when you use global statistical data and apply it to the individual.   After you established that rasists are scared people with low intellectual abilities you suggest it would be okay to ""beat the shit out of them""??  Advocating violence against any mentally disabled or challenged group sound very distasteful to me,  even if said group hold erroneous believes due to said disability. You are preaching a high form of intolerance here.  Whether socioeconomic status can explain the IQ gab between blacks and whites is still a debated question. There are for example studies suggesting that the IQ gab persists when you control for these factors. You might be right but the results are not as conclusive as you make them sound. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study  The Eyferth study for example is interesting because the white girls got an average IQ score of 93 even though as you probably know, the average IQ of white girls is 100, the article you linked from Wikipedia even discuses this and suggests potential sampling error. As I said, you could be correct in your assumptions but these questions are still argued over so you should not present them as ""Facts"".  Even though the human genome has been mapped, scientists are still trying to figure out what functions are correlation with which genes. Just three month ago 40 new genes where correlated with intelligence: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170523083324.htm  So to conclude that since no genetic difference has been found, would be fallacious.  This is still a debated issue but there are arguments supporting gene based IQ differences. One of them is the heritability of the g factor. I do however agree that we should not jump to conclusions before the question has been resolved.  Blaming a group of people for some atrocity like WW2 is quite fallacious if not dishonest. This argument is just as bad as blaming the black people for the crimes some of them commit or worse; previously did..  If your motivation behind making this video was to preach tolerance and abolish rasism I give you credit. But if this was the goal you could have gone about it in a better way.  Your video could be seen as advocating intolerance and hate, the very thing I hope you fight against? Calling the intellectually inferior rasists; ""dumb tribal monkeys"" and ""inbreed rednecks"" is not the path to a discussion nor understanding, it is the path to the opposite. You description of them should make us pity them and help them, not hate and beat them, right?

I don't know what kind of seizures he had, but when Hank called them ""severe"", I'm assuming he meant tonic-clonic seizures (the ones most people think of when they think about what a seizure is). They generally last a minute or two, but more severe ones last a longer time and can cause serious damage or death. Seizures generally have a ""starting point"" where the electrical excitation gets out of hand in the neurons and then proceeds to spread to other areas, causing the seizure. If the area that was consistently the starting point in his seizures was removed, it would make sense that his seizures would stop.",3,2016-03-07T04:31:29.000Z,0.125877192982,0.259210526316,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/trouble-in-mind/201201/hm-the-man-no-memory,False,False

What Richards says is basically true, because there is no singificant evidence that soy lower testosterone. But it is still ongoing research, and they conclude ""Soy does not appear to significantly affect testosterone levels in moderation (1-2 servings of soy food daily, less than 25g of soy protein from non-concentrate sources), and seems to be able to adversely affect testosterone levels when superloaded (enough so that the equol issue is moot; around 100mg isoflavones daily). Between moderation and excess, there is a grey area that is dependent on whether or not one is able to produce equol from daidzein.

What about all the fields that were put in place to grow your plant based food? Building those fields killed plenty of animals. I was raised on a farm that grew organic fruits and vegetables. To provide those organic fruits and vegetables we had to kill many animals so the produce would not be harmed. (i.e. groundhogs tearing up the fields...killed them. Deer eating the crops...killed them. The animals that are discrete like mice and rabbits...killed them.) The list goes on and on. Now you might hide behind the fact that you are not consuming them directly; however, you are just as responsible for the animals being killed to protect your plant based foods that I had to grow. The only way to stop the ""killing of animals"" is to have the human species die out. Before you all continue your endless ""hippie/eating bark"" argument realize that killing animals indirectly by building fields is the exact same thing as taking a cow to the slaughterhouse, just less discrete. You are so caught up in the ""save the earth"" mentality that you are blind to the fact that you are still killing it. Now if you switched to a vegetarian diet to be more healthy more power to you.

In fact more and more studies are saying that overall, eggs are good for your cholesterol levels : https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-thought/reevaluating-eggs-cholesterol-risk  Thing is, I think you're too close minded to see anything beyond your vegan dogma. The correlation between fat intake and increased risk of heart disease and cancer is clearly due to manufactured saturated and trans fatty acids. It's a fact, natural sources that contain saturated fats tend to contain high concentrations of different chemicals or sometimes micronutrients that negate the adverse effects of the purely concentrated form of the sat/trans fats, like cocoa beans (an example you'll appreciate).  I understand you m8, I was a vegan for 3 years myself because I thought it was the healthier and more noble choice. But again and again I found conflicting research about this, and through evolutionary studies, especially those studying the risk factors in Eskimos of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, even tho their diet is predominantly carnivorous. As for the animal cruelty, yes, it is horrible. But, without factory farming or human use these livestock species would go extinct. And the reason they're taxing on the environment is all the landscapes being biologically cleansed to plant food for them. Basically agriculture is the culprit, imagine what would happen to the planet if everyone was vegan, with the rise in the demand for agricultural foods, all the trees and species that will need to be killed.",0,2015-04-27T20:15:44.000Z,0.112464285714,0.557694444444,en,sciencenews,https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-thought/reevaluating-eggs-cholesterol-risk,True,False

And to find that I just search for ""place of human in the food chain"" in google, and you have lot of other site saying kind of the same thing.   What I say about human in the food chain is that we are not usefull to it, but I don't say we don't have an impact on it. The way humanity live now is destroying resources and life, but in the nature point of view, we are not suppose to be on top of the food chain, we are technically by the way we act, but naturally we aren't. That's what I try to explain. It's like human doesn't belong to earth, because the ecosystem work fine without him, but when another species disappear, the ecosystem change and become less balanced. So that's why I say human is not on the top of the natural food chain (I should maybe add the ""natural"" in first comment).",0,2015-04-24T18:23:51.000Z,0.12954545454500002,0.30701754386,en,livescience,http://www.livescience.com/4171-top-predators-key-ecosystem-survival-study-shows.html,False,False

The next year I gained 33 pounds of fat weight at 1700 calories a day with 4 days of working out for 2 hours with carbs being 50% of my calories.Over the last 2 months I have lost 20 pounds while eating  2700 calories a day with no carbs.

Spots like that are not unusual, and have many possible causes, though radiation is not one of them, especially in Tokyo in July 2011. Also, apparently healthy and green azaleas were growing all over Fukushima that summer, including in areas with much higher ground contamination levels than in Tokyo, so the ones in the picture probably died of something else.  31: 53   Children dropping dead of heart attacks from Cesium A claim like this requires solid documentation. Sudden cardiac death in young people is not unknown, and has many known causes, but cesium exposure is not considered one of them. http://cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/2/399 http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/features/sudden-cardiac-arrest-why-it-happens  42: 00   ""Don’t at any fish, seaweed miso from Japan, don’t let any kids go there…"" No need to even refute this.

Don’t eat anything you’re worried about. But I could easily point out parts of Australian cities where the radiation is higher than most of Japan.

This is an over-simplification at best. Children are more sensitive than adults for some types of cancer, less sensitive for others, and about the same for others.  ""Children were found to be more sensitive than adults for the development of about 25 per cent of tumour types including leukaemia, and thyroid, brain and breast cancer. The risk can be significantly higher, depending on circumstances. On the other hand, for about 15 per cent of cancer types such as colon, children were found to have the same radiation sensitivity as adults, and for 10 per cent of cancer types, such as those affecting the lungs, children were less sensitive than adults. Data were too weak to reach any conclusions for 20 per cent of cancers"" http://www.unscear.org/docs/temp/ous216eweb.pdf http://www.ncrponline.org/Annual_Mtgs/2012_Ann_Mtg/Mettler.pdf  5: 29     X ray machines in airports Again, she doesn’t discuss the huge difference between “backscatter” (airport machines) and “penetrating” X-rays, nor the doses and risks involved.  6: 38    100 tons of uranium fuel in each power plant This is not really true in the case of Fukushima Daiichi. Maybe the difference is small enough to let it slide, but she kept stressing “100 tons!” several times.  ""The reactor cores themselves contain less than 100 tons of fuel, Resnikoff noted.""  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-fuel-fukushima/  ""For a reactor with an output of 1000 megawatts (MWe), the core would contain about 75 tonnes of low-enriched uranium."" http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Introduction/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle-Overview/  ""4 reactors - 1852 tons (274 tons in reactors + 409 tons in reactor storage pools and 1169 tons in central pool)[1]"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Fukushima_and_Chernobyl_nuclear_accidents  10: 00   Long list of radioactive products from reactors and their health effects She seems to be implying that these are all equally dangerous in the quantities and concentrations emitted, but she includes no discussion of doses or concentrations at all.  13: 38  “Thorium is not useable in reactors” This is a weird misrepresentation.  The process has advantages as well as disadvantages, mainly from an economic standpoint.  But it is entirely feasible from a technical standpoint.  15: 00    Chernobyl story — hydroelectric engineer was running experiment This story is an extreme exaggeration and misrepresentation. There were many problems and several people responsible.  17: 00  Radioactive boars in Germany, “so radioactive they almost glow in the dark” Yes, boars in Germany (Bavaria in particular) are still radioactive. People should be aware of this. But she makes it ridiculous and dismissible by this hyperbole.  19: 27  One million gallons of water per minute needs to circulate in reactor See above. Some reactors will require this much, but most don’t.  24: 08       Atmospheric transport study, by Kyushu and Tokyo Univ researchers This is the paper: A Numerical Simulation of Global Transport of Atmospheric Particles Emitted from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sola/7/0/7_0_101/_pdf  A noted on EX-SKF: ""The relative scale is set with the density of radioactive materials at Fukushima I Nuke Plant as 1. By the time it reached North America, it was between 0.000001 and 0.00000001. ""  IOW, according to this simulation, the concentrations that arrived in N. America were one-millionth to one 100-millionth of what they were at Daiichi. Caldicott either did not understand this, or didn’t want her audience to know it.  28: 00   Tokyo as radioactive as Chernobyl dead zone Ian G. dealt with this in detail. I’d only add that yes, we found some surprisingly high “mini hotspots” in the Tokyo area, which usually had clear causes in terms of water collecting at the location. Local govts have sometimes been slow to respond to requests for cleanup, and citizens’ groups have played an important role in finding and publicizing such places. The Radiation Defense Project was run by a political activist who insisted that Tokyo should be evacuated, and he tried very hard to back up his claims to build support. The data might be reliable, but skepticism is called for because of the group’s political agenda. As mentioned, the group was fractious and extremist from the start, and has since disbanded.  40: 33  If Unit 3 collapses, there will be a “molten volcano” Some things, like a collapse of Unit 3, are not impossible but are nevertheless extremely unlikely. Regardless the “molten volcano” scenario has no basis in physics.  54: 42   Radioactive waste lasts for 1million years according to the EPA This is misleading enough to call it a myth. Yes, some of the waste materials would last that long; long half-lives means less radioactivity emitted and so safer in general. The more dangerous ones have shorter half-lives, though for some the time span may be measured in centuries. Also, the EPA’s Yucca Mountain standard uses a 10,000 year time period, while:  “In its 1995 report, “Technical Bases for Yucca Mountain Standards,” the National Academy of Sciences recommended that compliance with the standard be measured at the time of peak risk, ”within the limits imposed by the long-term stability of the geologic environment, which is on the order of one million years.” As the Academy noted, calculations for Yucca Mountain show that “peak risks might occur tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of years or even farther into the future.”” http://www.epa.gov/radiation/yucca/about.html  So the “million-year” time frame refers to the longterm stability of the geologic environment, not how long the waste lasts, and Caldicott seems to have confused the EPA with the NAS.  “Most nuclear wastes produced are hazardous, due to their radioactivity, for only a few tens of years and are routinely disposed in near-surface disposal facilities. A small volume of nuclear waste (~3% volume of total waste produced) is long-lived and highly radioactive and requires isolation from the environment for many thousands of years.” http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Nuclear-Wastes/Radioactive-Wastes---Myths-and-Realities/",4,2015-04-04T04:58:43.000Z,0.026675531914900002,0.416941489362,en,scientificamerican,http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-fuel-fukushima/,False,False

The immigrated with the european colonists  - Honey bees are the cause for large scale mono crop production in the agricultural revolution because of a few facts:       ---They can seek out and pollinate plants up to 5km away from their beehive       --- Honey bees are VERY efficient pollinators in the fact that they, as a eusocial organism, seek out specific plants as a colony that offer the BEST source of nectar and pollen in their ecosystem and systematically maximize their yield from it       --- Honey bees are incredibly adaptable, even to a genetic level (http://www.nature.com/news/job-swapping-makes-its-mark-on-honeybee-dna-1.11418)  - Native bees make up over 1 million in diverse species found throughout North America (http://www.xerces.org/pollinator-conservation/native-bees/)   - Many native bees offer pollination service within a small range (within 100m of their nest) and because they lay only up to a max of 300 individuals (bumble bees) and 20 individuals (solitary bees) within each females lifespan, there is less dependancy on BULK pollen and nectar, and therefore, these bee species are more resilient to variability in weather and climate over time.  - Other invertebrates and organisms offer pollination: beetles, flies, moths, butterflies, wasps, birds, bats, etc (http://www.xerces.org)   - Solitary bees are actually responsible for most alfalfa pollination (http://www.pollinator.ca/canpolin/alfalfa_lcb.html)   So, what does this ACTUALLY mean for our future if honey bee populations dwindle to the point of no return? It means that the current commercial food production model of mono cropping will fail. This means no more bulk purchasing of imported items at a subsidized rate, eating out of season, nor supply and demand principals (this is an issue with water anyways and drought is likely to cause our cheap rate for tomatoes in February to discontinue)  So, what CAN we expect? less mono crop, more diversity! And the American government knows this too and is actually doing something about it:  http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/using-farmbill-programs-for-pollinator-conservation.pdf  But, instead of promoting ACTIONABLE items to the world, it is media like this that continues to exacerbate the issue, making people feel helpless, encouraging even more rhetoric on how we are screwed by big-pharma when really, it is ALL OF US WHO CAN ACT by growing your own garden, creating habitat for native bees, learning to ID these bees and support them by creating hedgerows and micro-environemnts of gardens, trees and green spaces to support them.   I am a beekeeper, I teach beekeeping for a living and to be honest, it is awesome. The fear of losing bees has encouraged more engagement and observation and consideration for our urban ecosystems then I thought possible in the past 6 years. But it is a continuation of this unimaginative, dated, and depressing rhetoric that keeps movements from gaining capacity as it leaves all those moving toward supporting ALL bees in a head space of eminent failure. We need to have progressive, positive, realistic and focussed approaches to this issue, and FEAR IS NOT AN OPTION.

Here is 8 minutes of (Harvard/Oxford/Cornell/NIH) video proof (& there is more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists and doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists.

Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?  Are you and your family eating farm animals that are fed other farm animals' ""slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure""? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  Don't deceive yourself into believing that the animals who give us eggs & dairy don't also suffer horribly: http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/factory/ALL/580/  IF YOU WANT TO LEARN VEGAN FROM THE BEST DOCTOR-SCIENTISTS:  If you want to understand eating vegan: Dr. John & Mary McDougall give you everything you need to know online, free of charge and ""have held nothing back...The pages that follow contain all of the information you need to successfully change your diet and lifestyle in order to quickly regain control of your health and appearance.

Here is 8 minutes of (Harvard/Oxford/Cornell/NIH) video proof (& there is more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists and doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists.

I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?  Are you and your family eating farm animals that are fed other farm animals' ""slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure""? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  Don't deceive yourself into believing that the animals who give us eggs & dairy don't also suffer horribly: http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/factory/ALL/580/  IF YOU WANT TO LEARN VEGAN FROM THE BEST DOCTOR-SCIENTISTS:  If you want to understand eating vegan: Dr. John & Mary McDougall give you everything you need to know online, free of charge and ""have held nothing back...The pages that follow contain all of the information you need to successfully change your diet and lifestyle in order to quickly regain control of your health and appearance.

Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.  All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives?

These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not.

(Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind': Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.  Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/  If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?

Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.  All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists.

The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives?

These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not.

(Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind': Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America.

Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language.

A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.  Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/  If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.

Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!

These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not.

(Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.

Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

(Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T.

This is the first sign of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the United States.

(THIS ARTICLE IS REAL IMPORTANT - search NutritionFacts.org for ""Harvard Mortality"" - the link gets cut out here - I think it's too long - I won't type ""search...for"" in future notes like this.) These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses.

Here's 8 minutes of video proof (& more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists & doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

THE FOURTH LINK DOCUMENTS  (in 5 minutes, 50 seconds) THAT BY TEN YEARS OF AGE, ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS HEART DISEASE - OUR BIGGEST KILLER. (peer-reviewed, science-journal-published studies.) (Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T.

This is the first sign of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the United States. So the question for most of us is not whether we should eat healthy to prevent heart disease, but whether we want to reverse the heart disease we may already have."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  ""On Monday, the results of two major Harvard studies were published, following more than 100,000 men and women—and their diets—for up to 22 years."" (THIS ARTICLE IS REAL IMPORTANT - search NutritionFacts.org for ""Harvard Mortality"" - the link gets cut out here - I think it's too long - I won't type ""search...for"" in future notes like this.) These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?

Here's 8 minutes of video proof (& more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists & doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

THE FOLLOWING THREE LINKS DOCUMENT (IN LESS THAN EIGHT MINUTES VIDEO) THE FOUR BIGGEST (PEER-REVIEWED & SCIENCE-JOURNAL-PUBLISHED) MEDICAL HEALTH SCIENCE LIFE LONGEVITY STUDIES EVER DONE. THE FOURTH LINK DOCUMENTS  (in 5 minutes, 50 seconds) THAT BY TEN YEARS OF AGE, ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS HEART DISEASE - OUR BIGGEST KILLER. (peer-reviewed, science-journal-published studies.) (Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T. Colin Campbell and colleagues showed that chronic diseases such as heart disease are not inevitable consequences of aging."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/ ""  ""Heart Disease Starts in Childhood: By age 10, nearly all kids have fatty streaks in their arteries. This is the first sign of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the United States. So the question for most of us is not whether we should eat healthy to prevent heart disease, but whether we want to reverse the heart disease we may already have."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  ""On Monday, the results of two major Harvard studies were published, following more than 100,000 men and women—and their diets—for up to 22 years."" (THIS ARTICLE IS REAL IMPORTANT - search NutritionFacts.org for ""Harvard Mortality"" - the link gets cut out here - I think it's too long - I won't type ""search...for"" in future notes like this.) These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?  Are you and your family eating farm animals that are fed other farm animals' ""slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure""? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  Don't deceive yourself into believing that the animals who give us eggs & dairy don't also suffer horribly: http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/factory/ALL/580/  IF YOU WANT TO LEARN VEGAN FROM THE BEST DOCTOR-SCIENTISTS:  If you want to understand eating vegan: Dr. John & Mary McDougall give you everything you need to know online, free of charge and ""have held nothing back...The pages that follow contain all of the information you need to successfully change your diet and lifestyle in order to quickly regain control of your health and appearance.

Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

If you're truly interested in the science of your (children's?) health, this could become your favorite health and nutrition site. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/.    THE FOLLOWING THREE LINKS DOCUMENT (IN LESS THAN EIGHT MINUTES VIDEO) THE FOUR BIGGEST (PEER-REVIEWED & SCIENCE-JOURNAL-PUBLISHED) MEDICAL HEALTH SCIENCE LIFE LONGEVITY STUDIES EVER DONE. THE FOURTH LINK DOCUMENTS  (in 5 minutes, 50 seconds) THAT BY TEN YEARS OF AGE, ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS HEART DISEASE - OUR BIGGEST KILLER. (peer-reviewed, science-journal-published studies.) (Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T. Colin Campbell and colleagues showed that chronic diseases such as heart disease are not inevitable consequences of aging."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/ ""  ""Heart Disease Starts in Childhood: By age 10, nearly all kids have fatty streaks in their arteries. This is the first sign of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the United States. So the question for most of us is not whether we should eat healthy to prevent heart disease, but whether we want to reverse the heart disease we may already have."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  ""On Monday, the results of two major Harvard studies were published, following more than 100,000 men and women—and their diets—for up to 22 years."" (THIS ARTICLE IS REAL IMPORTANT - search NutritionFacts.org for ""Harvard Mortality"" - the link gets cut out here - I think it's too long - I won't type ""search...for"" in future notes like this.) These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?  Are you and your family eating farm animals that are fed other farm animals' ""slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure""? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  Don't deceive yourself into believing that the animals who give us eggs & dairy don't also suffer horribly: http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/CAMPAIGNS/factory/ALL/580/  IF YOU WANT TO LEARN VEGAN FROM THE BEST DOCTOR-SCIENTISTS:  If you want to understand eating vegan: Dr. John & Mary McDougall give you everything you need to know online, free of charge and ""have held nothing back...The pages that follow contain all of the information you need to successfully change your diet and lifestyle in order to quickly regain control of your health and appearance.

Here are your ""facts"": 8 minutes of video proof (& more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists & doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists.

(Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T.

(THIS ARTICLE IS REAL IMPORTANT - search NutritionFacts.org for ""Harvard Mortality"" - the link gets cut out here - I think it's too long - I won't type ""search...for"" in future notes like this.) These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?

Not super detailed. It looks like only a couple of them directly tackle the benefits of a low carb vs low fat diets. Even the one's that shun saturated fat advise replacing it with monounsaturated fats, NOT carbohydrates. Many studies find that replacing SFA with carbs has little to no benefit.  A couple of the one's you posted reference the role of oxidized fatty acids in development of CHD. I think everyone can agree that oxidized fat(rancid fats, fats heated past their smoke point) elicits a inflammatory response. So do large amounts of refined sugars. Still doesn't support the low fat argument.

NASA has recently shown how Arsenic can substitute for Phosphorus as an RNA linker to polymerize it into RNA sequences without any need for ""helper"" proteins or catalysts. Basically there's now nothing missing from the recipe for abiogenesis to proceed under completely natural conditions. Amino acids & nucleotides form naturally, they are able to form linkages without designed catalysts. Short sequences are shown to self replicate. The rest is just proper circumstances.  These microbes THRIVED in a Phosphorus free environment. It's not just the phosphorus on the DNA that got swapped but every Phosphorus using molecule in the cell. For instance the cell membrane consists ofPhospholipid bilayers. It must be constructed substituting Arsenic. The power molecules for EVERY active function of any cell are ADP & ATP, (the P stands for Phosphorus).  This is a much bigger deal than it is made out to be.  There are scenarios where RNA chains are formed by contact with various naturally occurring catalysts. These chains can be randomly disconnected by sunlight. Broken chain segments can be rejoined to other chain segments which almost always does nothing interesting. But in the course of time with billions of such recombinations occurring perpetually in planets throughout the universe - at some time one chain would stumble upon one of the billions of sequences which enable it to self-replicate.",0,2018-01-05T18:08:41.000Z,0.043359557109599996,0.528741258741,en,sciencemag,http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/researchers-may-have-solved-origin-life-conundrum,True,True

I won't be unsubscribing as I'm too curious to see where this will end.... I guess you've always been pro vaccine and never anti-vaccine. All I can say is that I don't think you've adequately looked at the anti-vaccine information which in my view completely debunks all the pro vaccine information. If you've only looked at mercola and naturalnews.com, that's not really adequate and extensive enough research on the matter. Most of the sources you've used are mainstream medical pro-vaccine. You've got just one source for anti-vaccines which is vaclib, which is pretty good and you don't seem to have taken in the information presented there, only taken in instead the vaclib debunk spiel from sciencebasedmedicine.org. I would suggest you go back to the drawing table and actually try to understand the information presented by the anti-vaccine information campaign. I've looked into vaccines during the swine flu scare and I don't have children and don't know if I ever will have, but I would not recommend anyone to trust big pharma to shoot them up with anything!! Nada!!  Your far better of trusting your own immune system despite the pro-vaccine 'science' which is just propaganda, that's all it is: cooked figures, cooked statistics, massaged and selectively presented half truths that are essentially as good as lies. Just like autism is being more diagnosed now, guess what the other diseases that vaccines supposedly eradicated are being less diagnosed i.e. they are being renamed to fit with the vaccine PR! You can not trust the 'science' and the medical journals fully cause it and they are sponsored by big money and big interests just like the meat and dairy industry that you should know about, that wants us to be less than optimally fit and healthy and quite dumbed down and easily manipulated. The pharmaceutical companies are known for making 'mistakes' despite their high security procedures, where the live virus is actually too strong and causes the very outbreak its supposed to prevent, and they also often have been known to contain sterilizing agents, targeting South American, Black Africans.... highly despicable, immoral, unethical, unconscionable practices,unscrupulous and murderous.   Consider for a moment how long mankind has lived and survived and thrived on this planet without vaccines, and without big pharma?

An early 2014 report released by the Council of Foreign Relations to identify countries with the highest rates of disease outbreaks, accidently revealed that the most highly vaccinated populations are also those with the greatest number of outbreaks for those same infectious diseases.  This was especially the case for measles, mumps, rubella, polio and pertussis outbreaks.  The US, Canada, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand, and Japan—each with the highest number of mandated vaccines—led the list of nations. The Office of Medical and Scientific Justice, which analyzed the report, concluded that the Council’s report clearly suggests the theory of “herd immunity” is failing or was flawed to begin with.  Given the repeated incidences of infectious outbreaks in populations with 94% or more vaccine compliance, and the emergence of new viral strains, the concept of herd immunity should be forgotten. The Office offers several possibilities to explain the report: 1) vaccines are increasingly becoming ineffective and causing “immune dysfunction,” and 2) “vaccine antigen responses” may be reprogramming viruses while weakening the immune systems of the most vaccinated individuals.[4]""  http://healthimpactnews.com/2015/why-are-so-many-healthy-people-dying-from-the-flu-after-receiving-the-flu-shot/  http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2011/11/17/smoke-mirrors-and-the-disappearance-of-polio/  http://vactruth.com/2010/07/23/fact-vaccines-have-never-eradicated-anything-ever/",14,2015-02-24T23:52:37.000Z,0.14706814522,0.399149465671,en,globalresearch,http://www.globalresearch.ca/vaccine-mccarthyism-what-if-the-vaccine-paradigm-itself-is-deliberately-flawed/5427768,False,False

People who have researched diabetes for more than 11 years.""_ Yeah, you did provide sources, but it sort of requires you to understand what those sources are saying. You don't, however. The webmd.com source you provided says for type 1: ""Episodes of low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia) are common."" That is when we (type 1's) are being treated for the disease, which means insulin and only insulin. Insulin causes low blood sugar if you take too much, which is a frequent occurence in type 1 treatment. A hypoglycemic episode (low blood sugar) is even called an ""insulin reaction"" - it even says so in your source from the American Diabetes Association. A complete lack of natural insulin, which is what characterizes type 1, makes it physically impossible to get a low blood sugar without treatment - you literally die from high blood sugar within a few days without treatment in type 1.  Webmd also says for type 2: ""There are no episodes of low blood sugar level, unless the person is taking insulin or certain diabetes medicines."" This is because the first line treatment for type 2 is diet and exercise, not medications, which it is in type 1. Most healthy people don't even get low blood sugar out of the blue, so why should an untreated type 2 get it or untreated type 1 for that matter? But as a type 2 starts treatment, they can get low blood sugar, just like a type 1, but also only under treatment.  _""Also, just cause you never got low blood sugar doesn't mean it is the same for everyone.""_ I get low blood sugar all the time. I had one this night, actually. It is a symptom of too much insulin for a meal, or too much insulin combined with too much exercise and so on. It just doesn't happen without insulin being in the equation. And yes, it's like this for every single type 1 diabetic. It is the single most defining diagnostic criteria of the disease - a total lack of insulin, and again, without any insulin, you cannot get low blood sugar.  _""People who have researched diabetes for more than 11 years.""_ Yeah, and you are not one of them. Type 1 diabetics are so involved in the medical terminology and functionality of their disease, out of necessity, that many are better at taking care of it than their doctors are. This is because every part of our life revolves around food, blood sugar and insulin. I have to measure my blood sugar 10 times a day, have to weigh my food and count carbohydrates so I know how much insulin to inject (so it doesn't get too high) and have to take sugary foods with me outside, in case I get a low from injecting too much insulin.  _""Please provide me a link which proves what you are saying is true.""_  From webmd: http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/type-1-diabetes  ""In people with type 1 diabetes, sugar isn't moved into the cells, because insulin is not available. When sugar builds up in the blood instead of going into cells, the body's cells starve for nutrients and other systems in the body must provide energy for many important bodily functions. As a result, high blood sugar develops...""  ""If your health care provider suspects type 1 diabetes, he will first check for abnormalities in your blood (high blood sugar level). In addition, he may look for glucose or ketone bodies in the urine.""  From ADA: http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/blood-glucose-control/hypoglycemia-low-blood.html  ""Hypoglycemia may also be referred to as an insulin reaction, or insulin shock.""  ""Hyperglycemia is the technical term for high blood glucose (blood sugar). High blood glucose happens when the body has too little insulin or when the body can't use insulin properly.""  From wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1#Signs_and_symptoms  ""The subsequent lack of insulin leads to increased blood and urine glucose. The classical symptoms are polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger) and weight loss.""  From Diabetes New Zealand: http://www.diabetes.org.nz/living_well_with_diabetes/living_with_type_1_diabetes/low_blood_glucose_hypo  ""When we have Type 1 diabetes, our blood glucose levels get too high because we either have no insulin or only a minimal amount.""  From JDRF: http://jdrf.org/life-with-t1d/type-1-diabetes-information/control-and-management/low-blood-sugar/  ""Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is the most common and most dangerous condition for many people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Very low blood sugar may lead to insulin shock, which can be life threatening if not promptly treated. Low blood sugar occurs when the body has too little food/glucose or too much insulin.  The following are all potential reasons that a person with diabetes might have low blood sugar:  Too much insulin taken Eating less than usual Eating later than usual Insulin was injected at a site on the body where the absorption rate is faster than usual Injecting extra insulin after forgetting about a previous dose More exercise than normal Illness or injury Other hormones Medication interaction""  So, as you can see, *no one* is saying a type 1 can get a spontaneous low blood sugar.

Pharmaceutical companies do not prescribe any medicine, let alone anti-depressants, that is the job of doctors and more specifically, psychiatrists. 2. Maybe one of the reasons that they are prescribing the anti-depressants is that people are depressed, and they want to try something that works and can make their depression go away. 3. Yes, all companies, including pharmaceutical companies care about making money and that is the main reason that they want you to buy drugs. However, this does not change the fact that these drugs do help people get better and that vaccines have prevented major outbreaks of once deadly and prevalent diseases. If looking to the past isn't good enough for you, than look abroad to countries that are less well off. While they don't have to worry about the ""Tyranny and evil"" of pharma companies, they have to worry about more important things like the fact that they don't have companies making drugs or vaccines so they're populations are dying of things like measles, TB, and typhoid. 4.

While the general concept behind vaccination is quite valid the individual vaccines themselves should not be religiously accepted without any scrutiny by consumers as that would be a rather unscientific approach. Vaccines are a relatively new creation with a short track record. They often contain sketchy adjuvants which when consumed orally can be considered minute/safe amounts but when injected iv/im they can go places your body's natural defenses deny them. The great decrease in disease often attributed to vaccination could also be at least partially explained by an increased awareness of the germ theory of disease by the whole of society and the consequential increase in hygiene. Correlation does not imply causation =D. The pharmaceutical industry is in the business of making money, making their own studies (throwing out unfavorable results), and making sure the door between regulatory bodies and big business is wide open. Iatrogenic disease is the third leading cause of death in the US. Most scientific studies are probably wrong (corrupt researchers, poorly done, statistical error ect...). Given what I've pointed out above please do not advocate for forced vaccination because the picture is not black and white.

Not that I believe that vaccines cause it anyway. It seems to run in my family. I wouldn't be surprised if I got encephalitis from it. Then there is the pneumonia, with the way my lungs are now, I'd be screwed if I caught it let alone when I was a child. Not only that, I'm not gonna gamble with other people's lives like that. I hate needles, but I get my shots so that the risk of infecting others go down (not completely, vaccines aren't 100%). It's a good protection for those that can't get vaccinated due to health reasons. People that don't get their children are playing a risky game with their lives. They could be fine and not get it. They could get sick and only get the milder symptoms. Or they could get Pneumonia or Encephalitis and be permanently damaged for life. That's not taking into account the game you are playing with other kid's lives. Kids are generally very tactile with each other and usually haven't mastered manners like covering their mouth for instance. They may have a few classmates that have weak immune systems and cannot have the shot or also have parents that did not get them the vaccines. Even the vaccinated ones aren't 100% safe.  If just one of them has it, there is a good chance that it spreads during recess. Here are the complications for Measles from several sites.

This really is not normal practice, and only some articles are free of charge. Most students do have access to a large amount of article through their institution. How much access depends on your institution, but I just downloaded all the linked articles.  2) We can talk for hours about how certain feminist, or 'feminist', institutions have a questionable financial interest in keeping certain narratives alive, but the high cost of online academic article can not be blamed on academic feminism. Actually, it has nothing to do with them at all. Also, paying for articles has nothing to do with the funding of research. The payments are for the publisher and the magazine. There has been a lot of discussion in both the academic world and the mainstream media if this is justified or not, and if the journals need that money or not, and if science needs those magazines or not etc. etc.  http://www.nature.com/news/open-access-the-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676 http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd/Profile/publications/Edlin-Rubinfeld%20ALJ%20Paper.pdf http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist  The above are just some of the first hits of a quick google search. (It also shows again how common expensive articles are.)  3) Access to published articles has nothing to do with peer review. An article will only get published AFTER it went through peer review. This doesn't mean in any way that there aren't problems with peer review, and mistakes do happen, since it remains the work of people. Standards and quality of review vary between both academic fields and publications, but generally authors do not get to decide who reviews their articles. There are almost always some anonymous reviewers too.  (Of course, if a certain questionable theory is popular in a scientific field chances are high the article will get through peer review, since even if authors don't know eachother they share the same views. For instance, I wouldn't trust information about human evolution in some self-proclaimed postmodern feminist philosophy publication, since the reviewers are likely not as knowledgeable about genetics as they are about philosophy, (and even the latter can be doubted.))",2,2015-02-02T17:09:02.000Z,0.0726577380952,0.47505059523800003,en,nature_news,http://www.nature.com/news/open-access-the-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676,True,False

Also, keep in mind how vague the notion that “many similarities between organisms indicate that they are closely related while fewer similarities between animals indicate that they are less closely related” is. Though this notion is a very, very, very rudimentary notion used in regards to evolution, it is not specific as the more complicated reasoning behind the theory of evolution. OFNF attacks this extremely vague notion and uses his criticism of the notion to attack the whole theory of evolution. This is a clear example of straw-manning a position if there ever was one. This will be made clear later on. At 3:30 he makes a distinction between the facts and the interpretation of the facts. He concedes that there are many similarities between organisms at 3:36. However, he does not concede that the fact that animals have similarities implies that animals who share many similarities are closely related. In fact, he states that such an assumption is merely an interpretation of the fact that organisms possess many similarities. He seems to believe that the phylogenetic tree is based solely on the vague assumption that the more similarities that animals have then the more they are related while the less similarities animals have between each other indicates that they are less related. However, he never elaborates on what he means by “similarities” and he never elaborates on what specific animals he is talking about until later on. Well, he sort of elaborates later on. He also claims that “evolutionists” only teach one side of the story as if there is some sort of valid alternative to evolution in the discipline of biology. He also claims that “evolutionists” go through great lengths to ban the controversy regarding evolution from being taught in the class room. He also states that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence while keeping contrary evidence out of the class room. He again states that the “facts” state otherwise. At this point this is where we sort of get into the details. OFNF goes on to cite an article titled “Rewriting Evolution: Tiny molecules called microRNAs are tearing apart traditional ideas about the animal family tree.” as an example of “evolutionists” ignoring contrary evidence. Humorously, he highlights the part of the title that states that microRNA is changing the order of the family tree of evolution yet ignores that the title implies that evolution will still be true being that the title says that evolution is being rewritten and not being shown to be false. He then quotes a part of the article which includes molecular paleobiologist at Dartmouth College, Kevin Peterson’s own words.   “’I’ve looked at thousands of microRNA genes, and I can’t find a single example that would support the traditional tree,” he says. The technique “just changes everything about our understanding of mammal evolution’.”   Here we see another sign of the inconsistency of OFNF’s reasoning. Earlier in the video he stated that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence to evolution yet OFNF cites Peterson (someone he considers an evolutionist) that deals directly with evidence that OFNF considers contrary to evolution. The rest of the article cites other evolutionists who are not ignoring what OFNF considers contrary evidence. This is a tad bit hilarious. He claims that evolutionists are ignoring contrary evidence yet cites a whole article of “evolutionists” not ignoring the very data that OFNF feels is contrary to evolution.  Even funnier is that nothing in the article is contrary to evolution. The article states that Peterson’s findings are contrary to the traditional evolutionary branches on the evolutionary tree yet Peterson’s evidence still supports an evolutionary tree. For example, the article OFNF cites shows a picture of a side-by-side comparison of the traditional evolutionary tree of placental mammals and Kevin Peterson’s evolutionary tree of placental mammals on the PDF of the article. What OFNF fails to communicate is that the two different branches in the side-by-side comparison still show that placental mammals are still a closely related family on their own branch no matter which branch is correct on this side-by-side comparison. Essentially, it is the order and placement of twigs on the branch that is in question. It is not evolution that is in question. Peterson’s evidence is still in support of evolution. OFNF’s claim that there is controversy within the biological community is overstated. If anything the article is great news because it shows that we are improving our understanding of biological evolution. If Peterson is right then we will only make the theory of evolution a stronger theory. If Peterson is wrong then it still makes the theory of evolution a stronger theory. It is a win-win situation being that Peterson’s evidence supports evolution anyways. However, Peterson’s data has not yet been confirmed as the article states.   At 5:06 OFNF continues on to state that in order to get published in peer-reviewed scientific journals one’s results have to line up with the theory of evolution regardless if your data is irrefutable. According to OFNF, if your data doesn’t line up with evolution then your work doesn’t get published and people will have a bias against you. OFNF then supports his assertion by quote mining the article at 5:21. Quote:   “At first, Peterson and Sempere had a tough time publishing their results suggesting that animals had accumulated regulatory microRNAs. ‘One of the reviewers said it was impossible, what we were describing,’ says Peterson.”   OFNF seems to gloss over the two sentences right after the quote he cites that states that Peterson’s papers were eventually published.   “In the end, the work was published in a specialized zoology journal. Subsequent papers, however, won over some sceptics and Peterson was soon publishing in Nature and Science”   Keep in mind that Nature and Science are very prestigious and mainstream science journals that did not ignore Peterson’s findings.   Furthermore, Peterson’s papers were not initially rejected because his data did not align with the theory of evolution. His data was rejected because it was brand new data that has never been seen at the time, period. This is how science works. New data must survive tons of scrutiny before getting published so as to maintain a high standard within the discipline. Sometimes new data gets rejected a few times when going through the peer-review process before finally gaining acceptance. The peer-review process is exactly how Newton and Einstein’s findings gained acceptance. Their findings were scrutinized and sometimes rejected but soon gained acceptance. Peterson’s findings gained acceptance the same way. OFNF then states that creationists have their own scientific journals because of this alleged bias. However, it is clear that OFNF is wrong. He then quotes the same article but only quotes those that disagree with Peterson’s findings. OFNF does not show you the quotes that show that not everyone in the same field as Peterson disagrees with Peterson. After all, Peterson would not have been able to get published if no one agreed with him. Nonetheless, here’s a quote from the same article OFNF quote mines that shows that others agree with Peterson’s microRNA findings:    “That has won him many critics, but also some strong supporters. ‘Peterson and his col­leagues have demonstrated that microRNAs are a powerful tool in determining the rela­tionships of major animal groups,’ says Derek Briggs, director of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, Connecticut.”       Elsewhere in the article, evolutionary bioinformatician, Peter Stadler agrees:   “‘It is a really clever and fresh approach to phylogeny,’ says Peter Stadler, an evolutionary bioinformatician at the University of Leipzig in Germany. ‘I don’t quite know why pres­ence/absence of microRNAs is not used more frequently in deep phylogeny approaches.’”   It is clear that scientists are divided on this matter and it is clear that the matter is a work in progress as the article indicates.   OFNF then quotes an abstract of a paper entitled the “Gene tree discordance, phylogenetic inference and the multispecies coalescent”. This is a sophomore move from OFNF. A simple Wikipedia search will show that abstracts are very limited and that the full article should be consulted. Consulting an abstract alone is inadequate when trying to get the full picture. Based on what OFNF quoted from the abstract, Wikipedia is actually right. What OFNF forgiven quoted from the abstract is not very specific at all. At 6:48 OFNF quotes from the abstract stating:   “…conflicting genealogical histories often exist in different genes throughout the genome…resolving close species relationships is not quite as simple as applying more data to the problem.”   From these two statements and a small quote from the article OFNF claims that the article shows genetic trees are different depending on what set of genetic data one looks at but he does not elaborate to what extent the trees are changed. Is the entire evolutionary tree different such that bees fall on a twig on the evolutionary branch of placental mammals or are the differences in genetic trees minor such that tiny twigs of closely related species fall on different places of slightly bigger twig but still strongly support the theory of evolution? OFNF never elaborates on this. However, the abstract OFNF quotes states that resolving [close] species relationships is not simple which indicates that the major branches on the evolutionary tree are well confirmed but it is the minute details of the twigs on this tree which needs further investigation and refining. In other words, the evolutionary tree has been demonstrated. At 8:10, OFNF cites the paper titled “Mapping Human Genetic Ancestry” (http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/10/2266.full.pdf+html), and uses the paper to argue against evolution. The paper does state that human evolution is not entirely certain but the paper does state that human evolution did occur. It is also certain that the great apes are closely related and share a common ancestor as is shown in table 2 and 3 of the paper. The paper also doesn’t ignore the incongruent data. The paper actually addresses the data directly and admits to the incongruent data though OFNF ignores that while once again falsely claiming that contrary data is ignored. It seems like it is OFNF that is ignoring the data. OFNF also states that phylogenetic trees cannot be used to prove the family tree but he fails to realize that they are one in the same. He also fails to realize that the family tree cannot be proven because new data can always turn up which could change current phylogeny (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/phylogenetics_05). In fact, no science is ever proven exactly because new data can always change current scientific knowledge. All scientific theories are tentative so it is nonsensical for OFNF to ask for the family tree to be proven. The evolutionary tree has already been demonstrated anyways. At 9:38 OFNF quotes the article with Kevin Peterson once again and asserts that AAT is only paying attention to what conforms to AAT’s supposedly preconceived notion that the theory of evolution is correct a priori. However, I have already shown how OFNF has grossly misrepresented the article which renders his charge against ATT superfluous. OFNF then moves on to talk about ERVs but OFNF doesn’t just talk about ERVs, he grossly misrepresents what ERVs tell us about evolution. OFNF argues that it is very likely that chimps and humans would share identical ERV sites while still acquiring ERV cites independently because there are so many cites (~30,000) in human DNA and ERV cites do not occur in random spots. Even granting OFNFs constraints, his argument still does not explain why only specific species share the same exact ERV cites that others do not. For instance, the HERV-K insertion is only shared among various primates. Also, small cats (e.g. the jungle cat, European wildcat, African wildcat, blackfooted cat, and domestic cat) under the family Felidae all share a specific retrogene insertion not found in any other carnivore. Is OFNF going to argue that the matching EVR insertions that are exclusive to primates occurred independently for each primate species but match up perfectly by coincidence? How about the ERV insertion that small cats in the Felidae family share? Did that insertion occur independently of every species in that group but just happens to match up perfectly while that same insertion is completely absent from all other animals? I think not. Clearly, he is just trying to discredit evolution even if his objections make no sense. Given that ERVs are only passed down to descendants it is clear that animals that share ERVs are related and small groups of different species that exclusively share ERVs all share common ancestry. Basically, ERVs do support evolution despite OFNF’s objections in this video.

According to OFNF, if your data doesn’t line up with evolution then your work doesn’t get published and people will have a bias against you. OFNF then supports his assertion by quote mining the article at 5:21. Quote:   “At first, Peterson and Sempere had a tough time publishing their results suggesting that animals had accumulated regulatory microRNAs. ‘One of the reviewers said it was impossible, what we were describing,’ says Peterson.”   OFNF seems to gloss over the two sentences right after the quote he cites that states that Peterson’s papers were eventually published.   “In the end, the work was published in a specialized zoology journal. Subsequent papers, however, won over some sceptics and Peterson was soon publishing in Nature and Science”   Keep in mind that Nature and Science are very prestigious and mainstream science journals that did not ignore Peterson’s findings.   Furthermore, Peterson’s papers were not initially rejected because his data did not align with the theory of evolution. His data was rejected because it was brand new data that has never been seen at the time, period. This is how science works. New data must survive tons of scrutiny before getting published so as to maintain a high standard within the discipline. Sometimes new data gets rejected a few times when going through the peer-review process before finally gaining acceptance. The peer-review process is exactly how Newton and Einstein’s findings gained acceptance. Their findings were scrutinized and sometimes rejected but soon gained acceptance. Peterson’s findings gained acceptance the same way. OFNF then states that creationists have their own scientific journals because of this alleged bias. However, it is clear that OFNF is wrong. He then quotes the same article but only quotes those that disagree with Peterson’s findings. OFNF does not show you the quotes that show that not everyone in the same field as Peterson disagrees with Peterson. After all, Peterson would not have been able to get published if no one agreed with him. Nonetheless, here’s a quote from the same article OFNF quote mines that shows that others agree with Peterson’s microRNA findings:    “That has won him many critics, but also some strong supporters. ‘Peterson and his col­leagues have demonstrated that microRNAs are a powerful tool in determining the rela­tionships of major animal groups,’ says Derek Briggs, director of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, Connecticut.”       Elsewhere in the article, evolutionary bioinformatician, Peter Stadler agrees:   “‘It is a really clever and fresh approach to phylogeny,’ says Peter Stadler, an evolutionary bioinformatician at the University of Leipzig in Germany. ‘I don’t quite know why pres­ence/absence of microRNAs is not used more frequently in deep phylogeny approaches.’”   It is clear that scientists are divided on this matter and it is clear that the matter is a work in progress as the article indicates.   OFNF then quotes an abstract of a paper entitled the “Gene tree discordance, phylogenetic inference and the multispecies coalescent”. This is a sophomore move from OFNF. A simple Wikipedia search will show that abstracts are very limited and that the full article should be consulted. Consulting an abstract alone is inadequate when trying to get the full picture. Based on what OFNF quoted from the abstract, Wikipedia is actually right. What OFNF forgiven quoted from the abstract is not very specific at all. At 6:48 OFNF quotes from the abstract stating:   “…conflicting genealogical histories often exist in different genes throughout the genome…resolving close species relationships is not quite as simple as applying more data to the problem.”   From these two statements and a small quote from the article OFNF claims that the article shows genetic trees are different depending on what set of genetic data one looks at but he does not elaborate to what extent the trees are changed. Is the entire evolutionary tree different such that bees fall on a twig on the evolutionary branch of placental mammals or are the differences in genetic trees minor such that tiny twigs of closely related species fall on different places of slightly bigger twig but still strongly support the theory of evolution? OFNF never elaborates on this. However, the abstract OFNF quotes states that resolving [close] species relationships is not simple which indicates that the major branches on the evolutionary tree are well confirmed but it is the minute details of the twigs on this tree which needs further investigation and refining. In other words, the evolutionary tree has been demonstrated. At 8:10, OFNF cites the paper titled “Mapping Human Genetic Ancestry” (http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/10/2266.full.pdf+html), and uses the paper to argue against evolution. The paper does state that human evolution is not entirely certain but the paper does state that human evolution did occur. It is also certain that the great apes are closely related and share a common ancestor as is shown in table 2 and 3 of the paper. The paper also doesn’t ignore the incongruent data. The paper actually addresses the data directly and admits to the incongruent data though OFNF ignores that while once again falsely claiming that contrary data is ignored. It seems like it is OFNF that is ignoring the data. OFNF also states that phylogenetic trees cannot be used to prove the family tree but he fails to realize that they are one in the same. He also fails to realize that the family tree cannot be proven because new data can always turn up which could change current phylogeny (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/phylogenetics_05). In fact, no science is ever proven exactly because new data can always change current scientific knowledge. All scientific theories are tentative so it is nonsensical for OFNF to ask for the family tree to be proven. The evolutionary tree has already been demonstrated anyways. At 9:38 OFNF quotes the article with Kevin Peterson once again and asserts that AAT is only paying attention to what conforms to AAT’s supposedly preconceived notion that the theory of evolution is correct a priori. However, I have already shown how OFNF has grossly misrepresented the article which renders his charge against ATT superfluous. OFNF then moves on to talk about ERVs but OFNF doesn’t just talk about ERVs, he grossly misrepresents what ERVs tell us about evolution. OFNF argues that it is very likely that chimps and humans would share identical ERV sites while still acquiring ERV cites independently because there are so many cites (~30,000) in human DNA and ERV cites do not occur in random spots. Even granting OFNFs constraints, his argument still does not explain why only specific species share the same exact ERV cites that others do not. For instance, the HERV-K insertion is only shared among various primates. Also, small cats (e.g. the jungle cat, European wildcat, African wildcat, blackfooted cat, and domestic cat) under the family Felidae all share a specific retrogene insertion not found in any other carnivore. Is OFNF going to argue that the matching EVR insertions that are exclusive to primates occurred independently for each primate species but match up perfectly by coincidence? How about the ERV insertion that small cats in the Felidae family share? Did that insertion occur independently of every species in that group but just happens to match up perfectly while that same insertion is completely absent from all other animals? I think not. Clearly, he is just trying to discredit evolution even if his objections make no sense. Given that ERVs are only passed down to descendants it is clear that animals that share ERVs are related and small groups of different species that exclusively share ERVs all share common ancestry. Basically, ERVs do support evolution despite OFNF’s objections in this video.

He also states that Talk Origins misrepresents the “facts”. Throughout this video he constantly refers to the facts however he never makes it quite clear what facts he is talking about. From 1:00 to 2:06, AbusiveAntiTheist (AAT) explains what ERVs are and explains that the animals we are closely related to share more of the same ERVs than animals we are not closely related to. OFNF then concedes that AAT’s explanation would be reasonable if evolution were true. Obviously, OFNF does not consider evolution true. Keep in mind that the explanation AAT gave in this video is an explanation showing that organisms that are closely related will have more similarities than organisms that are less related. Also, keep in mind how vague the notion that “many similarities between organisms indicate that they are closely related while fewer similarities between animals indicate that they are less closely related” is. Though this notion is a very, very, very rudimentary notion used in regards to evolution, it is not specific as the more complicated reasoning behind the theory of evolution. OFNF attacks this extremely vague notion and uses his criticism of the notion to attack the whole theory of evolution. This is a clear example of straw-manning a position if there ever was one. This will be made clear later on. At 3:30 he makes a distinction between the facts and the interpretation of the facts. He concedes that there are many similarities between organisms at 3:36. However, he does not concede that the fact that animals have similarities implies that animals who share many similarities are closely related. In fact, he states that such an assumption is merely an interpretation of the fact that organisms possess many similarities. He seems to believe that the phylogenetic tree is based solely on the vague assumption that the more similarities that animals have then the more they are related while the less similarities animals have between each other indicates that they are less related. However, he never elaborates on what he means by “similarities” and he never elaborates on what specific animals he is talking about until later on. Well, he sort of elaborates later on. He also claims that “evolutionists” only teach one side of the story as if there is some sort of valid alternative to evolution in the discipline of biology. He also claims that “evolutionists” go through great lengths to ban the controversy regarding evolution from being taught in the class room. He also states that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence while keeping contrary evidence out of the class room. He again states that the “facts” state otherwise. At this point this is where we sort of get into the details. OFNF goes on to cite an article titled “Rewriting Evolution: Tiny molecules called microRNAs are tearing apart traditional ideas about the animal family tree.” as an example of “evolutionists” ignoring contrary evidence. Humorously, he highlights the part of the title that states that microRNA is changing the order of the family tree of evolution yet ignores that the title implies that evolution will still be true being that the title says that evolution is being rewritten and not being shown to be false. He then quotes a part of the article which includes molecular paleobiologist at Dartmouth College, Kevin Peterson’s own words.   “’I’ve looked at thousands of microRNA genes, and I can’t find a single example that would support the traditional tree,” he says. The technique “just changes everything about our understanding of mammal evolution’.”   Here we see another sign of the inconsistency of OFNF’s reasoning. Earlier in the video he stated that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence to evolution yet OFNF cites Peterson (someone he considers an evolutionist) that deals directly with evidence that OFNF considers contrary to evolution. The rest of the article cites other evolutionists who are not ignoring what OFNF considers contrary evidence. This is a tad bit hilarious. He claims that evolutionists are ignoring contrary evidence yet cites a whole article of “evolutionists” not ignoring the very data that OFNF feels is contrary to evolution.  Even funnier is that nothing in the article is contrary to evolution. The article states that Peterson’s findings are contrary to the traditional evolutionary branches on the evolutionary tree yet Peterson’s evidence still supports an evolutionary tree. For example, the article OFNF cites shows a picture of a side-by-side comparison of the traditional evolutionary tree of placental mammals and Kevin Peterson’s evolutionary tree of placental mammals on the PDF of the article. What OFNF fails to communicate is that the two different branches in the side-by-side comparison still show that placental mammals are still a closely related family on their own branch no matter which branch is correct on this side-by-side comparison. Essentially, it is the order and placement of twigs on the branch that is in question. It is not evolution that is in question. Peterson’s evidence is still in support of evolution. OFNF’s claim that there is controversy within the biological community is overstated. If anything the article is great news because it shows that we are improving our understanding of biological evolution. If Peterson is right then we will only make the theory of evolution a stronger theory. If Peterson is wrong then it still makes the theory of evolution a stronger theory. It is a win-win situation being that Peterson’s evidence supports evolution anyways. However, Peterson’s data has not yet been confirmed as the article states.   At 5:06 OFNF continues on to state that in order to get published in peer-reviewed scientific journals one’s results have to line up with the theory of evolution regardless if your data is irrefutable.

The paper does state that human evolution is not entirely certain but the paper does state that human evolution did occur. It is also certain that the great apes are closely related and share a common ancestor as is shown in table 2 and 3 of the paper. The paper also doesn’t ignore the incongruent data. The paper actually addresses the data directly and admits to the incongruent data though OFNF ignores that while once again falsely claiming that contrary data is ignored. It seems like it is OFNF that is ignoring the data. OFNF also states that phylogenetic trees cannot be used to prove the family tree but he fails to realize that they are one in the same. He also fails to realize that the family tree cannot be proven because new data can always turn up which could change current phylogeny (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/phylogenetics_05). In fact, no science is ever proven exactly because new data can always change current scientific knowledge. All scientific theories are tentative so it is nonsensical for OFNF to ask for the family tree to be proven. The evolutionary tree has already been demonstrated anyways. At 9:38 OFNF quotes the article with Kevin Peterson once again and asserts that AAT is only paying attention to what conforms to AAT’s supposedly preconceived notion that the theory of evolution is correct a priori. However, I have already shown how OFNF has grossly misrepresented the article which renders his charge against ATT superfluous. OFNF then moves on to talk about ERVs but OFNF doesn’t just talk about ERVs, he grossly misrepresents what ERVs tell us about evolution. OFNF argues that it is very likely that chimps and humans would share identical ERV sites while still acquiring ERV cites independently because there are so many cites (~30,000) in human DNA and ERV cites do not occur in random spots. Even granting OFNFs constraints, his argument still does not explain why only specific species share the same exact ERV cites that others do not. For instance, the HERV-K insertion is only shared among various primates. Also, small cats (e.g. the jungle cat, European wildcat, African wildcat, blackfooted cat, and domestic cat) under the family Felidae all share a specific retrogene insertion not found in any other carnivore. Is OFNF going to argue that the matching EVR insertions that are exclusive to primates occurred independently for each primate species but match up perfectly by coincidence? How about the ERV insertion that small cats in the Felidae family share? Did that insertion occur independently of every species in that group but just happens to match up perfectly while that same insertion is completely absent from all other animals? I think not. Clearly, he is just trying to discredit evolution even if his objections make no sense. Given that ERVs are only passed down to descendants it is clear that animals that share ERVs are related and small groups of different species that exclusively share ERVs all share common ancestry. Basically, ERVs do support evolution despite OFNF’s objections in this video.

Then you claimed the interpretations are valid due to the number of available examples that all use the same faulty interpretations. Hence circular reasoning.    You can't claim that a skull reconstruction is valid evidence for evolution based on fragments and evolutionary presuppositions. You can't claim ancestor descendant relationships through the shapes of bones. At best its a faith based argument.  So you refuse to look at the downright fraud in evolutionary biology? If you don't think the field should be held responsible for it's blatant fraud then who should? You certainly hold creation responsible for the same thing based on your earlier comments about the discovery institute.   Why couldn't it be an extinct ape? Are you seriously going to claim an ancestor descendant relationship because of a similarity in bone structure? For that matter its just as good evidence for common design.    Dismiss all you want. You're going to dismiss my entire argument anyway regardless of whether I provide evidence or not. You had already dismissed my argument before you even heard it. You don't care what evidence I bring. Your mind is made up already.    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/recent_genetic_research_shows034291.html   Do you know why they use mice as test subjects? Because they're so genetically similar to you. If you didn't know that you shouldn't be arguing on the subject. Seriously.    Well if you're saying genetic similarity Is evidence for common descent Then that must go for bananas too. I'm sorry but that's your argument not mine.   The same link I posted above covers the Neanderthals also. Yes the Neanderthal used to be a transitional form until it was genetically refuted.  How long have you been studying evolutionary biology? It seems like there's a lot of very common knowledge things that you are unaware of.   Many of those defining features in Lucy are not defining features their interpretations of parts that we don't have. Like the feet for instance. We didn't find any bones from the shins down. Therefore the defining feature of human feet doesn't exist it was made up by evolutionists. Later examples of Australopithecus have ape feet. The hip is another made up defining feature. Based on a more recent examples we know that Australopithecus was a knuckle walker.    The only difference between my belief in your beliefs are starting points. You reject the supernatural therefore any conclusion has to be naturalistic. I'm willing to accept the supernatural. We are using the exact same facts and based on our starting point our interpretations come to a different conclusion. Listen, I have a bachelors in science in an IQ of 180. I was evolutionist a year and a half ago. I know all of your arguments and I know the evidence that goes along with it because I use to make the exact same arguments you're making. As soon as I accepted the fact that there is a God and was willing to accept the supernatural my opinions changed. My opinions are based purely on science. You trying to make me look like just some ignorant Christian that doesn't know any better is a fallacy. You're the one that can't come up with evidence to support your position therefore you're talking my position.     I told you you would reject my source. Its like I was saying before. You don't want sources you've already made up your mind. That's why it's a waste of time for me to post links. You will just be demanding the exact same sources from me in two weeks in another thread.   Why don't you provide a source now on a single debate between creationists about where to draw the line of human and ape. Because I think you just made that up. That's blatantly false. The red line is hard and it's not like Obama's red line. lol   So when I make a joke out of your arguments you blame me on using standard creationist arguments. lol. You're making the exact same atheist arguments. In fact many of your arguments are actually outdated considering the evidence that's been found. I'm surprised you haven't brought up the busted 98% genetic similarity in apes. lol.   When have you given me observable example that don't require faith? Simply the fact that I can come up with an argument against your examples shows that it requires faith to believe in it. Irrefutable doesn't mean that only accepted answers are valid.  It means that there's no other explanation but the one given. Facts are the fossils themselves. All you have given me is interpretations of the facts not facts.    Yes it is where the evidence lead me. When I first became a Christian I believed in evolution.  It wasn't until critically looking at the evidence that I changed my position. I have since found the opinion of theistic evolution unreconcilable.

And to answer your question quickly: The body stops producing melanin at about the age of 30-40. Why? We dont know. And about that long answer... This is from an article published in 2002: ""For parents, unruly children are the obvious cause of gray hair. To scientists, the situation is more complex. As D.J. Tobin, who heads a team that studies dermopathology at the University of Bradford in England, points out, the matter is an issue of genetics and aging.   Melanin, a chemical produced by specialized cells within each hair follicle, is responsible for giving hair color. Different types of melanin are responsible for different types of hair color-eumalinin for brown or black hair and pheomelanin for yellow or red hair. The type of melanin an individual has is controlled by pigment cells that are, in turn, determined by genes. As we age, the pigment cells at the base of our hair follicles stop producing melanin; without the chemical, our hair turns white.   The body has no central source for melanin, such as a gland; the chemical is produced for each strand of hair: This is why hairs tend to go gray individually.

And though it will increase your chances of birthing a healthy baby, it is a bit unorthodox, to say the least. Still, scientists at Icelandic biotechnology company deCODE genetics say that when third and fourth cousins procreate, they generally have scads of kids and grandkids (relative to everyone else).  It has long been wondered exactly how kinship influences reproductive success. Previous studies have uncovered positive correlations, but the biological data has been clouded by socioeconomic factors (such as average marrying age and family size) in those populations in which consanguineous marriage is commonplace, such as in India, Pakistan and the Middle East. The new study, however, was able to shed light on the biological reason for the earlier findings. Scientists came to their conclusions after studying the records of more than 160,000 Icelandic couples with members born between 1800 and 1965. ""The advantage of using the Icelandic data set lies in this population being small and one of the most socioeconomically and culturally homogenous societies in the world,"" the researchers report in Science, ""with little variation in family size [and] use of contraceptives and marriage practices, in contrast with most previously studied populations.""  The results of the exhaustive study are constant throughout the generations analyzed. Women born between 1800 and 1824 who mated with a third cousin had significantly more children and grandchildren (4.04 and 9.17, respectively) than women who hooked up with someone no closer than an eighth cousin (3.34 and 7.31). Those proportions held up among women born more than a century later when couples were, on average, having fewer children. Despite the general pattern for reproductive success favoring close kinship, couples that were second cousins or more closely related did not have as many children. The most likely reason, scientists say: offspring of such close relatives were likely to have much shorter life spans, because of the chance of inheriting harmful genetic mutations. ""With close inbreeding—between first cousins—there is a significant increase in the probability that both partners will share one or more detrimental recessive genes, leading to a 25 percent chance that these genes will be expressed in each pregnancy,"" says Alan Bittles, director of the Center for Human Genetics at Edith Cowan University in Joondalup, Australia, who was not involved in the study.  Interestingly, one evolutionary argument for mating with a relative is that it might reduce a woman's chance of having a miscarriage caused by immunological incompatibility between a mother and her child. Some individuals have an antigen (a protein that can launch an immune response) on the surface of their red blood cells called a rhesus factor—commonly abbreviated ""Rh."" In some cases—typically during a second pregnancy—when a woman gets pregnant, she and her fetus may have incompatible blood cells, which could trigger the mother's immune system to treat the fetus as a foreign intruder, causing a miscarriage. This occurrence is less probable if the parents are closely related, because their blood makeup is more likely to match. ""It may well be that the enhanced reproductive success observed in the Iceland study at the level of third [and] fourth cousins, who on average would be expected to have inherited 0.8 percent to 0.2 percent of their genes from a common ancestor,"" Bittles says, ""represents this point of balance between the competing advantages and disadvantages of inbreeding and outbreeding.""",0,2014-04-01T05:08:27.000Z,0.13297715965600002,0.34539800995,en,scientificamerican,http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-incest-is-best-kissi/,False,False

This is a significant contribution in a continent in which gay relationships are criminalised in 38 out of 55 countries, four of which impose the death penalty.  The study used a panel of non-partisan volunteer experts to assess the considerable and often contradictory literature on biological, social and environmental factors in sexual diversity. It is one of the most clear-sighted evaluations that I have encountered, and it deserves to be taken very seriously in Africa and elsewhere.  A range of sexuality  The nub of the report is its conclusion that diversity in human sexuality is:  … a range of human variation, very little of which can justifiably be termed abnormal. The source of this variation has been contentious for decades, despite the accumulating evidence that nature (“born gay”) is overwhelmingly more significant than nurture (“lifestyle choice”).  The report has a large and readable section on biological factors in homosexuality, including neurohormone effects on the fetus, and “epigenetic” influence on the activity of genes by chemical modifications that can be modified by the environment and are transmitted to all the cells of the individual, and sometimes even between generations.  As the report summarises, family studies over decades show that gay men are more likely than average to have gay brothers, and lesbian women more likely to have lesbian sisters.  Many twin studies showing that identical twins are twice as likely as non-identical twins to be concordant (both straight or both gay) imply a clear genetic component, but the 70% concordance leaves room for considerable non-genetic effect. This is true whether or not the twins were raised together.  A 1993 report of a gay gene on the X chromosome has been recently confirmed by a larger study, with the addition of another one or two gay genes.  To me, the most compelling argument that homosexuality is just one end of a normal spectrum is its prediction by evolutionary theory, which I have explored in detail previously.  Knowing about the wide variety of sexual behaviours in the animal kingdom, we can understand human sexuality in a broader context than our own society. It would be truly remarkable if humans had evolved without strong selection for mate choice genes.  Mate choice is one of the most highly selected traits in any animal. Just ask a fruitfly, which devotes a large share of its genes to choosing and attracting a mate.  Not gay genes, but male-loving variants  As I wrote previously, I think there will turn out to be many – maybe hundreds – of gay genes. But these should be considered “male-loving” variants of mate choice genes. In a female, a male-loving variant will induce her to mate earlier and have more children, making up for her gay brother. Makes sense.  I was happy to see in the report a discussion of data showing that the female relatives of gay males have more children than average women, thus preventing the gay gene from extincting itself.  There is so far no evidence for a “female-loving” variant that induces the brothers of lesbians to have more children, but it would be surprising if there weren’t many of them too.  We know of many “sexually antagonistic” genetic variants like this, which have opposite effects on the “genetic fitness” (that is, numbers of children) of males and females.  So, everyone has a grand mixture of male- and female-loving variants. This explains why there is such a broad spectrum of mate preference among both males and females.  It’s a bit like height, in which there are variants of many genes (estimates of more than 1000) predisposing to tall or short stature. Everyone – males and females – has a mixture. Some males and some females will be either very short or very tall, but most will be somewhere in the middle.  In the same way, I propose that there is a distribution from the very male-loving to the very female-loving among both males and females. Gays and lesbian people simply represent one extremes at one end of this distribution. Hypersexualised heterosexual males and females represent the other end.  Perhaps even more importantly, the report rejects the concepts that homosexuality is learned from, or results from behaviour of parents or peers, that it can rub off on others, and that it can be “treated”.  The report concludes that:  Contemporary science increasingly recognises the wide range of natural variation in human sexuality, sexual orientations and gender identities. The report argues that it is important for countries to accept that sexual diversity is normal. There are severe consequences of persecuting and criminalising LGBTI, and not just directly for individuals and particular communities.  By persecuting, marginalising and criminalising whole sets of sexual behaviour, societies as a whole may quickly lose the public health battle against HIV-AIDS and other sexual health scourges, experience higher levels of social violence, and ignore other serious issues like violence against women and children.   Uganda’s Constitutional Court nullified an anti-homosexuality law in August 2014. Reuters/Edward Echwalu The politics of homosexuality and role of science academies  It could be said that ASSAf has gone way beyond its scientific limitations by summarising its findings as:  Sexual diversity has always been part of a normal society and there is no justification for attempts to eliminate people who are not heterosexual from society. Efforts should rather be focused on countering the stigmatisation that creates hostile and violent environments. Alternatively, this report may be criticised for not going far enough down the political path to removing criminal sanctions, stigma and persecution. However, every academy – including the Australian Academy of Science – must jealously guard its non-partisan reputation in order to be taken seriously.  ASSAf’s mandate is “to provide evidence-based science advice to government and other stakeholders on matters of critical national importance”. I believe ASSAf has done this. It is now up to other bodies to use the clearly stated scientific conclusions as a sharp-edged weapon to dispel myths and repel bigots.  It is often said that it is ineffective to fight illogical fears and hatreds with facts and logic, and it is sadly true that common sense and respect for data don’t always win out – think climate change and vaccination. But academies of science would risk their reputations, and mortgage their influence with governments of any persuasion, were they to go down the track of fighting irrational fear with emotive appeals.    http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/the-two-spirit-people-of-indigenous-north-americans.html   Native Americans have often held intersex, androgynous people, feminine males and masculine females in high respect. The most common term to define such persons today is to refer to them as ""two-spirit"" people, but in the past feminine males were sometimes referred to as ""berdache"" by early French explorers in North America, who adapted a Persian word ""bardaj"", meaning an intimate male friend. Because these androgynous males were commonly married to a masculine man, or had sex with men, and the masculine females had feminine women as wives, the term berdache had a clear homosexual connotation. Both the Spanish settlers in Latin America and the English colonists in North America condemned them as ""sodomites"".  We-Wa, a Zuni Two Spirit.Rather than emphasising the homosexuality of these persons, however, many Native Americans focused on their spiritual gifts. American Indian traditionalists, even today, tend to see a person's basic character as a reflection of their spirit. Since everything that exists is thought to come from the spirit world, androgynous or transgender persons are seen as doubly blessed, having both the spirit of a man and the spirit of a woman. Thus, they are honoured for having two spirits, and are seen as more spiritually gifted than the typical masculine male or feminine female.  Therefore, many Native American religions, rather than stigmatising such persons, often looked to them as religious leaders and teachers. Quite similar religious traditions existed among the native peoples of Siberia and many parts of Central and southeast Asia. Since the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Siberia over 20,000 years ago, and since reports of highly respected androgynous persons have been noted among indigenous Americans from Alaska to Chile, androgyny seems to be quite ancient among humans.  A Two Spirit.Rather than the physical body, Native Americans emphasised a person's ""spirit"", or character, as being most important. Instead of seeing two-spirit persons as transsexuals who try to make themselves into ""the opposite sex"", it is more accurate to understand them as individuals who take on a gender status that is different from both men and women. This alternative gender status offers a range of possibilities, from slightly effeminate males or masculine females, to androgynous or transgender persons, to those who completely cross-dress and act as the other gender. The emphasis of Native Americans is not to force every person into one box, but to allow for the reality of diversity in gender and sexual identities.  Most of the evidence for respectful two-spirit traditions is focused on the native peoples of the Plains, the Great Lakes, the Southwest, and California. With over a thousand vastly different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, it is important not to overgeneralise for the indigenous peoples of North America. Some documentary sources suggest that a minority of societies treated two-spirit persons disrespectfully, by kidding them or discouraging children from taking on a two-spirit role. However, many of the documents that report negative reactions are themselves suspect, and should be evaluated critically in light of the preponderance of evidence that suggests a respectful attitude. Some European commentators, from early frontier explorers to modern anthropologists, also were influenced by their own homophobic prejudices to distort native attitudes.  Another photograph of We-Wa, a Zuni two-spirit, weaving. Two-spirit people were respected by native societies not only due to religious attitudes, but also because of practical concerns. Because their gender roles involved a mixture of both masculine and feminine traits, two-spirit persons could do both the work of men and of women. They were often considered to be hard workers and artistically gifted, of great value to their extended families and community. Among some groups, such as the Navajo, a family was believed to be economically benefited by having a ""nadleh"" (literally translated as ""one who is transformed"") androgynous person as a relative. Two-spirit persons assisted their siblings' children and took care of elderly relatives, and often served as adoptive parents for homeless children.  A Two Spirit known as We-Wa.A feminine male who preferred to do women's work (gathering wild plants or farming domestic plants) was logically expected to marry a masculine male, who did men's work (hunting and warfare). Because a family needed both plant foods and meat, a masculine female hunter, in turn, usually married a feminine female, to provide these complementary gender roles for economic survival. The gender-conforming spouse of two-spirit people did not see themselves as ""homosexual"" or as anything other than ""normal"".  In the 20th-century, as homophobic European Christian influences increased among many Native Americans, respect for same-sex love and for androgynous persons greatly declined. Two-spirit people were often forced, either by government officials, Christian missionaries or their own community, to conform to standard gender roles. Some, who could not conform, either went underground or committed suicide. With the imposition of Euro-American marriage laws, same-sex marriages between two-spirit people and their spouses were no longer legally recognised. But with the revitalisation of Native American ""red power"" cultural pride since the 60s, and the rise of gay and lesbian liberation movements at the same time, a new respect for androgyny started slowly re-emerging among American Indian people.  Because of this tradition of respect, in the 90s many gay and lesbian Native American activists in the United States and Canada rejected the French word berdache in favour of the term two-spirit people to describe themselves. Many non-American Indians have incorporated knowledge of Native American two-spirit traditions into their increasing acceptance of same-sex love, androgyny and transgender diversity. Native American same-sex marriages have been used as a model for legalising same-sex marriages, and the spiritual gifts of androgynous persons have started to become more recognised.   http://io9.com/gay-marriage-in-the-year-100-ad-951140108/953627434  Gay marriage sounds like an ultra-contemporary idea. But almost twenty years ago, a Catholic scholar at Yale shocked the world by publishing a book packed with evidence that same-sex marriages were sanctioned by the early Christian Church during an era commonly called the Dark Ages.  Illustration of Serge and Bacchus, in a same-sex union  John Boswell was a historian and religious Catholic who dedicated much of his scholarly life to studying the late Roman Empire and early Christian Church. Poring over legal and church documents from this era, he discovered something incredible. There were dozens of records of church ceremonies where two men were joined in unions that used the same rituals as heterosexual marriages. (He found almost no records of lesbian unions, which is probably an artifact of a culture which kept more records about the lives of men generally.)  Bolstered by this evidence, Boswell published a book in 1994, the year before his death from AIDS, called Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe. The book comes out next month for the first time in a digital edition. It was an instant lightening rod for controversy, drawing criticism from both the Catholic Church and sex pundit Camille Paglia. Given the Church's present-day views on gay marriage, these detractors argued, Boswell's history seemed like wishful thinking.     But it wasn't. Boswell had actually begun his research back in the 1970s, and published an equally controversial work in 1980 called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century. His Same-Sex Unions book refined and expanded a lot of what he'd learned over a lifetime of research into primary sources in scattered libraries and archives.    How could these marriages have been forgotten by history? One easy answer is that — as Boswell argues — the Church reframed the idea of marriage in the 13th century to be for the purposes of procreation. And this slammed the door on gay marriage. Church scholars and officials worked hard to suppress the history of these marriages in order to justify their new definition.  Of course, history is more complicated than that. Boswell claims that part of the problem is that we define marriage so differently today that it's almost impossible for historians to recognize 1800-year-old gay marriage documents when they see them. Often, these documents refer to uniting ""brothers,"" which at the time would have been a way of describing same-sex partners whose lifestyles were tolerated in Rome. Also, marriages over a millennium ago were not based on procreation, but wealth-sharing. So ""marriage"" sometimes meant a non-sexual union of two people's or families' wealth. Boswell admits that some of the documents he found may refer simply to non-sexual joining of two men's fortunes — but many also referred to what today we would call gay marriage.  Gay marriage in the year 100 AD Legal scholar Richard Ante wrote a law journal article explaining that Boswell's book could even be used as evidence for the legality of gay marriage, since it shows evidence that definitions of marriage have changed over time. He describes some of Boswell's evidence of these same-sex rites in the early first millennium:  The burial rite given for Achilles and Patroclus, both men, was the burial rite for a man and his wife. The relationships of Hadrian and Antinous, of Polyeuct and Nearchos, of Perpetua and Felicitas, and of Saints Serge and Bacchus, all bore resemblance to heterosexual marriages of their times. The iconography of Serge and Bacchus was even used in same-sex nuptial ceremonies by the early Christian Church. The main piece of evidence that these same-sex unions were marriages is that they so closely resembled heterosexual ceremonies. Literary scholar Bruce Holsinger describes Boswell's detailed stories of same-sex ceremonies:  [Boswell] cleverly posits the development of heterosexual and same-sex nuptial offices as a single phenomenon, tracking the growth of the latter from ""merely a set of prayers "" in the earlier Middle Ages to its flowering as a ""full office"" by the twelfth century that involved ""the burning of candles, the placing of the two parties' hands on the Gospel, the joining of their right hands, the binding of their hands . . . with the priest's stole, an introductory litany crowning, the Lord's Prayer, Communion, a kiss, and sometimes circling around the altar."" Boswell devotes a full chapter to comparing these rituals with their heterosexual counterparts, revealing a number of extraordinary similarities between the two; in several appendixes totaling almost 100 pages, he has compiled numerous examples of the documents themselves (including heterosexual matrimony ceremonies and adoption rituals for comparison) to let ""readers . . . judge for themselves,"" as he puts it. (Boswell translates most of the ceremonies, so general readers won't have to worry about brushing up on their Old Church Slavonic.) Were these same-sex unions in the middle ages the same thing as today's gay marriages? Probably not. People at the time may not have viewed two men forming a union as anything out of the ordinary. Marriage itself meant something different thousands of years ago, and social taboos against homosexuality had not yet solidified. Still, in Boswell's work, we find records of institutions where same-sex couples were honored with the same ceremonies that opposite-sex couples enjoyed. Two men could live as ""brothers,"" sharing wealth, home, and family. And yes, they could love each other, too.  Though Boswell died before his country began to allow similar kinds of unions, he could draw hope from knowing something that most people did not.

This is a significant contribution in a continent in which gay relationships are criminalised in 38 out of 55 countries, four of which impose the death penalty.  The study used a panel of non-partisan volunteer experts to assess the considerable and often contradictory literature on biological, social and environmental factors in sexual diversity. It is one of the most clear-sighted evaluations that I have encountered, and it deserves to be taken very seriously in Africa and elsewhere.  A range of sexuality  The nub of the report is its conclusion that diversity in human sexuality is:  … a range of human variation, very little of which can justifiably be termed abnormal. The source of this variation has been contentious for decades, despite the accumulating evidence that nature (“born gay”) is overwhelmingly more significant than nurture (“lifestyle choice”).  The report has a large and readable section on biological factors in homosexuality, including neurohormone effects on the fetus, and “epigenetic” influence on the activity of genes by chemical modifications that can be modified by the environment and are transmitted to all the cells of the individual, and sometimes even between generations.  As the report summarises, family studies over decades show that gay men are more likely than average to have gay brothers, and lesbian women more likely to have lesbian sisters.  Many twin studies showing that identical twins are twice as likely as non-identical twins to be concordant (both straight or both gay) imply a clear genetic component, but the 70% concordance leaves room for considerable non-genetic effect. This is true whether or not the twins were raised together.  A 1993 report of a gay gene on the X chromosome has been recently confirmed by a larger study, with the addition of another one or two gay genes.  To me, the most compelling argument that homosexuality is just one end of a normal spectrum is its prediction by evolutionary theory, which I have explored in detail previously.  Knowing about the wide variety of sexual behaviours in the animal kingdom, we can understand human sexuality in a broader context than our own society. It would be truly remarkable if humans had evolved without strong selection for mate choice genes.  Mate choice is one of the most highly selected traits in any animal. Just ask a fruitfly, which devotes a large share of its genes to choosing and attracting a mate.  Not gay genes, but male-loving variants  As I wrote previously, I think there will turn out to be many – maybe hundreds – of gay genes. But these should be considered “male-loving” variants of mate choice genes. In a female, a male-loving variant will induce her to mate earlier and have more children, making up for her gay brother. Makes sense.  I was happy to see in the report a discussion of data showing that the female relatives of gay males have more children than average women, thus preventing the gay gene from extincting itself.  There is so far no evidence for a “female-loving” variant that induces the brothers of lesbians to have more children, but it would be surprising if there weren’t many of them too.  We know of many “sexually antagonistic” genetic variants like this, which have opposite effects on the “genetic fitness” (that is, numbers of children) of males and females.  So, everyone has a grand mixture of male- and female-loving variants. This explains why there is such a broad spectrum of mate preference among both males and females.  It’s a bit like height, in which there are variants of many genes (estimates of more than 1000) predisposing to tall or short stature. Everyone – males and females – has a mixture. Some males and some females will be either very short or very tall, but most will be somewhere in the middle.  In the same way, I propose that there is a distribution from the very male-loving to the very female-loving among both males and females. Gays and lesbian people simply represent one extremes at one end of this distribution. Hypersexualised heterosexual males and females represent the other end.  Perhaps even more importantly, the report rejects the concepts that homosexuality is learned from, or results from behaviour of parents or peers, that it can rub off on others, and that it can be “treated”.  The report concludes that:  Contemporary science increasingly recognises the wide range of natural variation in human sexuality, sexual orientations and gender identities. The report argues that it is important for countries to accept that sexual diversity is normal. There are severe consequences of persecuting and criminalising LGBTI, and not just directly for individuals and particular communities.  By persecuting, marginalising and criminalising whole sets of sexual behaviour, societies as a whole may quickly lose the public health battle against HIV-AIDS and other sexual health scourges, experience higher levels of social violence, and ignore other serious issues like violence against women and children.   Uganda’s Constitutional Court nullified an anti-homosexuality law in August 2014. Reuters/Edward Echwalu The politics of homosexuality and role of science academies  It could be said that ASSAf has gone way beyond its scientific limitations by summarising its findings as:  Sexual diversity has always been part of a normal society and there is no justification for attempts to eliminate people who are not heterosexual from society. Efforts should rather be focused on countering the stigmatisation that creates hostile and violent environments. Alternatively, this report may be criticised for not going far enough down the political path to removing criminal sanctions, stigma and persecution. However, every academy – including the Australian Academy of Science – must jealously guard its non-partisan reputation in order to be taken seriously.  ASSAf’s mandate is “to provide evidence-based science advice to government and other stakeholders on matters of critical national importance”. I believe ASSAf has done this. It is now up to other bodies to use the clearly stated scientific conclusions as a sharp-edged weapon to dispel myths and repel bigots.  It is often said that it is ineffective to fight illogical fears and hatreds with facts and logic, and it is sadly true that common sense and respect for data don’t always win out – think climate change and vaccination. But academies of science would risk their reputations, and mortgage their influence with governments of any persuasion, were they to go down the track of fighting irrational fear with emotive appeals.    http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/the-two-spirit-people-of-indigenous-north-americans.html   Native Americans have often held intersex, androgynous people, feminine males and masculine females in high respect. The most common term to define such persons today is to refer to them as ""two-spirit"" people, but in the past feminine males were sometimes referred to as ""berdache"" by early French explorers in North America, who adapted a Persian word ""bardaj"", meaning an intimate male friend. Because these androgynous males were commonly married to a masculine man, or had sex with men, and the masculine females had feminine women as wives, the term berdache had a clear homosexual connotation. Both the Spanish settlers in Latin America and the English colonists in North America condemned them as ""sodomites"".  We-Wa, a Zuni Two Spirit.Rather than emphasising the homosexuality of these persons, however, many Native Americans focused on their spiritual gifts. American Indian traditionalists, even today, tend to see a person's basic character as a reflection of their spirit. Since everything that exists is thought to come from the spirit world, androgynous or transgender persons are seen as doubly blessed, having both the spirit of a man and the spirit of a woman. Thus, they are honoured for having two spirits, and are seen as more spiritually gifted than the typical masculine male or feminine female.  Therefore, many Native American religions, rather than stigmatising such persons, often looked to them as religious leaders and teachers. Quite similar religious traditions existed among the native peoples of Siberia and many parts of Central and southeast Asia. Since the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Siberia over 20,000 years ago, and since reports of highly respected androgynous persons have been noted among indigenous Americans from Alaska to Chile, androgyny seems to be quite ancient among humans.  A Two Spirit.Rather than the physical body, Native Americans emphasised a person's ""spirit"", or character, as being most important. Instead of seeing two-spirit persons as transsexuals who try to make themselves into ""the opposite sex"", it is more accurate to understand them as individuals who take on a gender status that is different from both men and women. This alternative gender status offers a range of possibilities, from slightly effeminate males or masculine females, to androgynous or transgender persons, to those who completely cross-dress and act as the other gender. The emphasis of Native Americans is not to force every person into one box, but to allow for the reality of diversity in gender and sexual identities.  Most of the evidence for respectful two-spirit traditions is focused on the native peoples of the Plains, the Great Lakes, the Southwest, and California. With over a thousand vastly different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, it is important not to overgeneralise for the indigenous peoples of North America. Some documentary sources suggest that a minority of societies treated two-spirit persons disrespectfully, by kidding them or discouraging children from taking on a two-spirit role. However, many of the documents that report negative reactions are themselves suspect, and should be evaluated critically in light of the preponderance of evidence that suggests a respectful attitude. Some European commentators, from early frontier explorers to modern anthropologists, also were influenced by their own homophobic prejudices to distort native attitudes.  Another photograph of We-Wa, a Zuni two-spirit, weaving. Two-spirit people were respected by native societies not only due to religious attitudes, but also because of practical concerns. Because their gender roles involved a mixture of both masculine and feminine traits, two-spirit persons could do both the work of men and of women. They were often considered to be hard workers and artistically gifted, of great value to their extended families and community. Among some groups, such as the Navajo, a family was believed to be economically benefited by having a ""nadleh"" (literally translated as ""one who is transformed"") androgynous person as a relative. Two-spirit persons assisted their siblings' children and took care of elderly relatives, and often served as adoptive parents for homeless children.  A Two Spirit known as We-Wa.A feminine male who preferred to do women's work (gathering wild plants or farming domestic plants) was logically expected to marry a masculine male, who did men's work (hunting and warfare). Because a family needed both plant foods and meat, a masculine female hunter, in turn, usually married a feminine female, to provide these complementary gender roles for economic survival. The gender-conforming spouse of two-spirit people did not see themselves as ""homosexual"" or as anything other than ""normal"".  In the 20th-century, as homophobic European Christian influences increased among many Native Americans, respect for same-sex love and for androgynous persons greatly declined. Two-spirit people were often forced, either by government officials, Christian missionaries or their own community, to conform to standard gender roles. Some, who could not conform, either went underground or committed suicide. With the imposition of Euro-American marriage laws, same-sex marriages between two-spirit people and their spouses were no longer legally recognised. But with the revitalisation of Native American ""red power"" cultural pride since the 60s, and the rise of gay and lesbian liberation movements at the same time, a new respect for androgyny started slowly re-emerging among American Indian people.  Because of this tradition of respect, in the 90s many gay and lesbian Native American activists in the United States and Canada rejected the French word berdache in favour of the term two-spirit people to describe themselves. Many non-American Indians have incorporated knowledge of Native American two-spirit traditions into their increasing acceptance of same-sex love, androgyny and transgender diversity. Native American same-sex marriages have been used as a model for legalising same-sex marriages, and the spiritual gifts of androgynous persons have started to become more recognised.   @953627434  Gay marriage sounds like an ultra-contemporary idea. But almost twenty years ago, a Catholic scholar at Yale shocked the world by publishing a book packed with evidence that same-sex marriages were sanctioned by the early Christian Church during an era commonly called the Dark Ages.  Illustration of Serge and Bacchus, in a same-sex union  John Boswell was a historian and religious Catholic who dedicated much of his scholarly life to studying the late Roman Empire and early Christian Church. Poring over legal and church documents from this era, he discovered something incredible. There were dozens of records of church ceremonies where two men were joined in unions that used the same rituals as heterosexual marriages. (He found almost no records of lesbian unions, which is probably an artifact of a culture which kept more records about the lives of men generally.)  Bolstered by this evidence, Boswell published a book in 1994, the year before his death from AIDS, called Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe. The book comes out next month for the first time in a digital edition. It was an instant lightening rod for controversy, drawing criticism from both the Catholic Church and sex pundit Camille Paglia. Given the Church's present-day views on gay marriage, these detractors argued, Boswell's history seemed like wishful thinking.     But it wasn't. Boswell had actually begun his research back in the 1970s, and published an equally controversial work in 1980 called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century. His Same-Sex Unions book refined and expanded a lot of what he'd learned over a lifetime of research into primary sources in scattered libraries and archives.    How could these marriages have been forgotten by history? One easy answer is that — as Boswell argues — the Church reframed the idea of marriage in the 13th century to be for the purposes of procreation. And this slammed the door on gay marriage. Church scholars and officials worked hard to suppress the history of these marriages in order to justify their new definition.  Of course, history is more complicated than that. Boswell claims that part of the problem is that we define marriage so differently today that it's almost impossible for historians to recognize 1800-year-old gay marriage documents when they see them. Often, these documents refer to uniting ""brothers,"" which at the time would have been a way of describing same-sex partners whose lifestyles were tolerated in Rome. Also, marriages over a millennium ago were not based on procreation, but wealth-sharing. So ""marriage"" sometimes meant a non-sexual union of two people's or families' wealth. Boswell admits that some of the documents he found may refer simply to non-sexual joining of two men's fortunes — but many also referred to what today we would call gay marriage.  Gay marriage in the year 100 AD Legal scholar Richard Ante wrote a law journal article explaining that Boswell's book could even be used as evidence for the legality of gay marriage, since it shows evidence that definitions of marriage have changed over time. He describes some of Boswell's evidence of these same-sex rites in the early first millennium:  The burial rite given for Achilles and Patroclus, both men, was the burial rite for a man and his wife. The relationships of Hadrian and Antinous, of Polyeuct and Nearchos, of Perpetua and Felicitas, and of Saints Serge and Bacchus, all bore resemblance to heterosexual marriages of their times. The iconography of Serge and Bacchus was even used in same-sex nuptial ceremonies by the early Christian Church. The main piece of evidence that these same-sex unions were marriages is that they so closely resembled heterosexual ceremonies. Literary scholar Bruce Holsinger describes Boswell's detailed stories of same-sex ceremonies:  [Boswell] cleverly posits the development of heterosexual and same-sex nuptial offices as a single phenomenon, tracking the growth of the latter from ""merely a set of prayers "" in the earlier Middle Ages to its flowering as a ""full office"" by the twelfth century that involved ""the burning of candles, the placing of the two parties' hands on the Gospel, the joining of their right hands, the binding of their hands . . . with the priest's stole, an introductory litany crowning, the Lord's Prayer, Communion, a kiss, and sometimes circling around the altar."" Boswell devotes a full chapter to comparing these rituals with their heterosexual counterparts, revealing a number of extraordinary similarities between the two; in several appendixes totaling almost 100 pages, he has compiled numerous examples of the documents themselves (including heterosexual matrimony ceremonies and adoption rituals for comparison) to let ""readers . . . judge for themselves,"" as he puts it. (Boswell translates most of the ceremonies, so general readers won't have to worry about brushing up on their Old Church Slavonic.) Were these same-sex unions in the middle ages the same thing as today's gay marriages? Probably not. People at the time may not have viewed two men forming a union as anything out of the ordinary. Marriage itself meant something different thousands of years ago, and social taboos against homosexuality had not yet solidified. Still, in Boswell's work, we find records of institutions where same-sex couples were honored with the same ceremonies that opposite-sex couples enjoyed. Two men could live as ""brothers,"" sharing wealth, home, and family. And yes, they could love each other, too.  Though Boswell died before his country began to allow similar kinds of unions, he could draw hope from knowing something that most people did not. Even the most fundamental kinds of human relationships change over time.

Literary scholar Bruce Holsinger describes Boswell's detailed stories of same-sex ceremonies:  [Boswell] cleverly posits the development of heterosexual and same-sex nuptial offices as a single phenomenon, tracking the growth of the latter from ""merely a set of prayers "" in the earlier Middle Ages to its flowering as a ""full office"" by the twelfth century that involved ""the burning of candles, the placing of the two parties' hands on the Gospel, the joining of their right hands, the binding of their hands . . . with the priest's stole, an introductory litany crowning, the Lord's Prayer, Communion, a kiss, and sometimes circling around the altar."" Boswell devotes a full chapter to comparing these rituals with their heterosexual counterparts, revealing a number of extraordinary similarities between the two; in several appendixes totaling almost 100 pages, he has compiled numerous examples of the documents themselves (including heterosexual matrimony ceremonies and adoption rituals for comparison) to let ""readers . . . judge for themselves,"" as he puts it. (Boswell translates most of the ceremonies, so general readers won't have to worry about brushing up on their Old Church Slavonic.) Were these same-sex unions in the middle ages the same thing as today's gay marriages? Probably not. People at the time may not have viewed two men forming a union as anything out of the ordinary. Marriage itself meant something different thousands of years ago, and social taboos against homosexuality had not yet solidified. Still, in Boswell's work, we find records of institutions where same-sex couples were honored with the same ceremonies that opposite-sex couples enjoyed. Two men could live as ""brothers,"" sharing wealth, home, and family. And yes, they could love each other, too.  Though Boswell died before his country began to allow similar kinds of unions, he could draw hope from knowing something that most people did not. Even the most fundamental kinds of human relationships change over time. Those who have been banished today may be blessed tomorrow — just as they were over a thousand years ago.",0,2015-06-23T22:56:36.000Z,0.156675569942,0.427638173987,en,theconversation,http://theconversation.com/african-scientists-recognise-that-diverse-sexuality-is-the-norm-43050,False,False

But when Irish Americans began to invest in education, they completely closed the gap. Instead, Flynn argues that these trends become cumulative, and problems are already evident in preschool. He proposes some environmental explanations, including differences in attitudes toward academic achievement.

That hypothesis has been debunked for many years now. By now paleontologists have found unambiguous fossil impressions of feathers on non-avian dinosaurs. Microraptor is a famous example. Just the other day the discovery of Changyuraptor was announced. They were both dinosaurs with flight feathers on their arms and legs, but they were not avian dinosaurs, or birds (1). Furthermore, there are fossils of feathered dinosaurs so well preserved that examination of the feathers' melanosomes can give paleontologists a hint about their color. Microrapter was probably black like crows, and Anchiornis may have been colored like a woodpecker, while Sinosauropteryx, which had the more primitive proto-feathers, seems to have had a red and white ring tail. There is very little dispute among the paleontological community anymore that many dinosaur taxa had feathers and that birds are a clade of dinosaurs.  ""Reptile"" is not a scientifically useful term. It is a term describing superficial morphological characteristics, not genetic relatedness. The term biologists use that is compatible with modern cladistic taxonomy is ""sauropsid."" Don't be fooled by such superficial traits as integument and metabolism. For example, Dimetrodon was technically a reptile, with cold blood and scaly skin, but it was a synapsid, not a sauropsid, making it much more closely related to mammals than anything we call a reptile today. Even great white sharks are endothermic, but that doesn't mean they're not related to other sharks.  It's funny you should mention the differences between reptilian and avian respiratory systems. It was discovered only within the last few years that crocodilians, the closest living relatives to birds, have a very bird-like, unidirectional respiratory system. Considering that all your information regarding this topic is older than 10 years, it's understandable that you had doubts about the dinosaur-bird link.

There are estimated to be 931 genes on the X-chromosome (Ensembl version 26.35.1), ∼3.75% of all genes. In 2004, Online-Mendelian Inheritance in Man recorded 1237 entries for ‘mental retardation’. Of these, 333 (27%) mapped to the X-chromosome, suggesting X-linked genes play a disproportionate role in the development of human intelligence. Why should there be such a concentration on this particular chromosome (1)? Zechner et al. (2) suggest that the X-chromosome has been engaged in the development of sexually selected characteristics for at least 300 million years and that natural selection has favoured the development of X-linked genes that are associated with higher cognitive abilities_   ----- Neuroscientist David H.

The human populations - before the modern age - were geographically isolated in large, interbreeding groups with some groups not sharing an ancestor for over 100,000 years. More than enough - MUCH MORE - to evolve into different sub-species.<<   Even though I disagree with you in terms of the isolation, you still cant use that as a defense when considering the modern context of humanity.  We are not isolated.  And no, the first brach to leave was likely the people who would become the aboriginals.  East Asians extremely commonly interbred with them.  Ranging from places like Taiwan all the way to the islands before Papua New Guinea.   How long you been separated doesn't matter, it's based upon genetic material.  >>""There's always been mixed caucasoid and negroid populations in Africa.""  Do you mean Northern Africa? Even if you do, dubious assertion. What this has to do with there being sub-speciation in the Human population I can't really fathom. The 'schnoodle' does not make the poodle and the schnowser the same dog. :)<<   North and West Africa.  To be a sub-species you must be geographically isolated, if those geographic barriers are broken and there is interbreeding that whole dilemma is dissolved.  And this is broken by Egyptians, Arabs and by Europeans.  Specially when looking at how involves countries like Ethiopia where when dealing with middle Eastern affairs.  Especially Judaism and Christianity.  They were not isolated whatsoever.  >>""There's also been a massive amount of movement between the three which also contradicts a sub species.""  No it doesn't. Ibid.<<   It does when you take into context the definition of subspecies.  That is absolutely vital.  >>""That doesn't make a sub species.""  It doesn't make the hard fact of a sub-species but if you've got a better method for biologists to try then I suggest you publish a paper.<<   Ancestery.  We already use it, it's not subjective, and it's purely biological.  It's not a sub species.  Race includes culture which is completely subjective.  >>"" all individual humans on this planet have more than 99.9% of the same DNA.""  It's actually more like 99.5 but it's a typical piece of propaganda. Quantitative similarity doesn't indicate qualitative similarity in a perfect way. Also, that's around 15,000,000 genetic differences so given how much ONE GENE let alone 15,000,000 can change in the human being then you're actually proving my point for me.<<   The human genome contains 3 billion base pairs.  Pairs that consist of opposites involving four specific chemicals adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.  At large portion of our DNA is not even used for anything anymore, and differences often occur in those areas.  For example, humans and dogs have about 1000 specific genes dedicated for detecting odor but about 600 of them do not even work anymore in humans.      >>"" Doesn't matter if you're Australian aboriginal or European, the only true difference between the two populations are how a set number of very specific genes between the two populations influenced the production of specific hormones which influenced the individual's growth patterns""  Such nonsense is - as the cliche goes - the domain of only the very intelligent. Tripe. The morphology of different human groups is astoundingly different. Forensic anthropologists can - with around 6 or more data points - the ancestral origin of a particular set of bones approaching a degree of error of nil. Race - to counter the silly zeitgeist - is much more than skin deep.<<   Absolutely untrue. I personally studied under Dr. Marcella Sorg who is renowned throughout the entire northeastern United States for her skills and contributions to the field of forensic anthropology.     Ancestry is not even detectable until the individual has grown past a point in puberty.  And the same goes for sex.  Friends anthropologists such as Dr. Sorg completely discredit the notion of race because that involves culture.  Because it is subjective.   One of the most famous cases in Forensic Anthropology the United States came when there was a missing African-American gentlemen in New Jersey.  And they ended up finding the body of an individual who is either Native American or Southeast Asian, the African American family was contacted for DNA work and it was found that they had Native American ancestry that was introduced well over 150 years ago, yet it was still present in their features due to the dominance of the specific genes being passed down.   Anthropologists detect ancestry.  Forensic anthropologists do not attempt to find out race.  And I have plenty of people to back that up.  Unless I can visibly see the person, they don't try to make any claims beyond what they can find out by means of just ancestry.  Because race is subjective.  Person who self recognized themselves as African was thought to be native American or Southeast Asian.     Most states in the United States had agreements with Native Americans to donate the body to the tribe if it's native to be buried again.  But they often find our individuals who are mixed or even mostly European but we're heavily involved in Native American culture groups, so they are given two Native Americans even though they are primarily European or even entirely.  Not all the time, but often enough.  >>""Heck, Australian aboriginals and Europeans are the only populations on earth to have developed and maintain blond hair, naturally.  Which actually is not that difficult. ""  Interesting. Given that - like the African population in America - most Aboriginals in my country have some European blood I'd always assumed that that mutation came from our side. So the Aboriginal mutation arose pre-European contact?? Cool. Could you point me to an article about that.<<   http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/05/case-closed-blonde-melanesians-understood/#.Vgg88hNViko  >>""""And the answer is still no.  We are still ""Homo sapiens sapiens"" because not all people outside of Africa have DNA from those two organisms even noticeable within their genome.  Most people don't even have more than 1% which typically involves genes that are dormant.""""  You're right. I'd agree with all of that. Not that it changes the fact that there is obvious sub-speciation within the human family, though. :)<<   The definition of subspecies contradicts your claims though: ""a taxonomic category that ranks below species, usually a fairly permanent geographically isolated race.""  >>""The black population of the Americas is massive, and almost all of it contains neanderthal DNA.  This also includes a massive population of people north of the Congo.""   True but now you're making the mistake of confusing geography with ancestry, an annoying but common error. Byzantine period Egypt was full of Blondes and redheads from Europe. That didn't make them of African ancestry.<<   Hold on there, you are completely ignoring the context to how both populations got to those areas and the extreme differences they would've had with one another, economically and socially.  Not only that but just to the south of Egypt where Nubian tribes and a commonly had families with more fair skinned people in Egypt.  >>""The black population of the Americas is massive, and almost all of it contains neanderthal DNA.""  Indeed. The reason: because most of them have Nat American and European blood. Simple.<<   Ancestry, not blood.   >>""I am not a creationist, I am not a liberal, I am at humanist.""  Well just answer the question for me. It's a simple question, but hugely germane to the discussion. You're an egalitarian aren't you? You believe that the thing holding African Americans from their true potential is 'institutional racism' and not the low intelligence scores we find all over the world with African populations?<<   Egalitarian is very vague.  We don't fine low intelligence scores among African people, we find low intelligence scores among individuals.  It can be any color, background, etc.  For that assertion to be true all people of African descent would never be able to excel above any other population of people.  But that's not the case, socioeconomics plays a big part.  Populations that are impoverished, lack opportunity, discriminated against, and/or have a troubled family life almost always have lower test scores.  East Asians and Native Americans are biologically indistinguishable in many contexts, but East Asian always perform much better academically.  That's based around family culture, and income.     To generalize a population is to devalue your position, you must understand the difference between successful individuals.  Because even in white populations, you can breakdown intelligence simply by a families economic position and find similar ""overgeneralize results.""  And economics is just a tip of the iceberg, there is so much context.  Oversimplifying the issue is to prove one does understand the complexity.  >>""Sunny places have dark skin populations. Europe was much warmer than Asia, so even though both populations developed light skin, East Asians had genes that promoted the growth of eyelids to protect one's eyes form the cold and became highly successful.""  All completely meaningless phenotypic developments. I'm talking about selection for fundamental traits like altruism, high-trust, low-time preference, in-groups based on morality rather than kinship, intelligence and problem solving. YOU KNOW, THOSE THINGS THAT HELP MAKE OUR SOCIETY LIVABLE.<<   It's all dependent on the individual.  We fined successful societies are those that have access to more resources to allow more leisure time.  Every population to have develop agriculture did advanced rapidly, but the only civilizations to develop agriculture were those who had access to crops that could easily be grown and maintained while being able to feed a large population.  China and Rome did this amazingly well.   But even then, a lot of these things (in the context of morality and problem-solving) aren't even measurable because you need to set a standard which in many cases can't be done due to how subjective they are.  You'd also have to see them everybody in set population behaves in a similar manner, and it doesn't work like that.  >>""There're more differences between us individually then been there are when comparing entire populations to one another.""  Lewontin's fallacy. Slimy Marxistr liars like Richard should be avoided at all cost. Don't you actually want to learn the beautiful truth of our existence and not be crammed into this modern Lysenkoism????<<   Not at all, that is literally the truth.  Simply calling it a fallacy doesn't make it a fallacy.  If the genetic information corresponds with this claim, which it does, it's not a fallacy.  Also, this is not Marxism.  Marxism is a political ideology.  Social Marxism isn't even related to Marx himself.  It seems that you want to justify race, not understanding if it's actually real.  Karl Marx was a crybaby, and deemed anybody who owned property to be evil regardless if it benefited them or not.  Nobody cares about him and I don't.   Ancestry is real, race is subjective.  That is pointblank.  Until you understand how many cultural factors are included into race, and how you can't just biologically pick out what race someone is because it includes much more than biology, you'er going to believe it's real due to one element that is specifically known as ancestery while trying to defend all the parts of race that are not able to uphold the biological test.   >>""You're almost 100% going to find a European and an Australian aboriginal with similar brains to one another, then a European wood with another European who has a mental disorder. Which show up in populations which often at random and can occur at any population.""  Now you're branching off into the bizarre. So somehow because the brain of a typical European is more different to a European with Down Syndrome than it is to a typical Australoid means............ something to you? :)<<   Down syndrome is a genetic disorder.  Mental disorders include a much larger spectrum of things.  You should know better than that.  Mental retardation is a mental disorder, but it's hardly the only one.  Narcissism is also a mental disorder in many contexts.  >>""My magical world?  It has the same pressures, it just needs a lot more of them and a much bigger timeframe.  Humans have not been separated enough for the differences between us to truly capitalize on our slight differences.""  Tripe again. You've got to read Nicholas Wade's brilliant but controversial book ""Troublesome Inheritance"", as he puts it evolution has recent, copious and regional. It's time for truth to reign again, not slimy egalitarian fantasies. (I'm not calling you slimy, I'm just saying that the people who have been pushing this tripe for a century are slimy, Marxist liars. Political advocates dressed up as scientists).  Take care, too.<<    That is what I feel the problem is.  Many people simply refuse two of knowledge race as a cultural construct because you believe that somehow gives power to cultural Marxists and so forth.  First of all, Marxism is all about property ownership and how factory jobs making people replaceable devalues a person's individuality.  Social Marxism doesn't even make sense to me.  It seems more like an excuse for people who deemed any form of social progression as ""dangerous"" to their way of life.  Regardless I've if it's actually true/beneficial or not.   I mean I don't really like Marx but he still had good points, he was against slavery.  Do you support slavery simply because Karl Marx was against that?  Because that's how I feel when people try to justify race simply because it's ""social Marxism"" if they don't or some crap like that.

It does not. This is a common misconception. As proved by Wheeler's DCQE, what causes the collapse of the wavefunction is acquiring information (called which-path in this context) about the system, all particles pass through detectors, but not all of them are collapsed, so detector cannot be the cause of collapse and, therefore, cannot account for observation; the physical detectors merely entangle themselves with the system in a Von Neumann Chain.  The physical part was left out intentionally because it is not what causes the collapse.  So Wheeler, Zeilinger, Heisenberg and everyone else who knows that the collapse does not happen through physical interactions are ""new age post modernists""? What the fuck, dude? Have you ever heard of the Quantum Randi Challenge?  Cognitive awareness can. In fact, in the Shrodinger cat's gedanken, knowledge of the quantum system can be obtained by observing the state of the cat. And no, please don't pretend to be so uninformed (unless you really are), quantum effects were already demonstrated in objects big enough to be seen by the nacked eye, as well as through astronomical distances (the entanglement of two states of a photon caused by gravitational lensing of a distant massive galaxy)... Also to happen inside our noses to help our sense of smell, to happen inside bird's brains to help them migrate and to be the very way our brain process information.  It was the physicists themselves who proliferated this idea. Von Neumann, Wigner, Heisenberg, Aspect, Wheeler, Zeilinger, etc, they are/were the actual physicists involved in the creation of Quantum Mechanics.  Everyone can observe the state of his own brain, this is called ""making a decision"", when you collapse the other options and stick only to one.  Observing the state has nothing to do with knowing how the brain works. You are clearly confusing terms here.  A topological qubit is formed in our microtubules through the superposition of electrons in the carbon rings of the molecules of tryptophan that forms them. This was observed inside our neurons in laboratory. For you to say it has nothing to do with what is found in the brain is to prove you are too scientifically illiterate to have this conversation. Here is the source, if you care to know: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm  All scientific literate neuroscientist will use the term ""qubit"" to refer to the topological qubits inside our neurons.  No, I am just an undergraduate physicist who actually is into scientific news. Which aren't even so ""new"".  Even more plausible: I am speaking science, you are speaking bias.  I don't want to believe anything, I want to know. And this is where science plays an important role.  I didn't, I clearly understand what integrating information is, at least better than you, since it is part of my area of study.

The most recent species carbon dated to about 7,700 years ago, in Siberia. Viable alternate theories exist: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1006_041006_giant_deer.html  Wouldn't the existence of high heals, corsets, strip clubs, domestic abuse, and being subject to male dominance in society and at home show that gender ornamentation and disposability are not exclusively male issues? Are men expected to wear makeup? Are they expected to get in bed at the first invitation, and called a ""slut"" or ""whore"" if they don't? Women have been made into the peacocks in the human species, although now it's becoming an issue for both genders to make themselves beautiful.   On a separate note, have you ever been in fear of your life because a woman looked you up and down? No? Well many women have that happen when men do it to them, so let's not pretend men are overall the victims of women. If you want to compare cases of victimization, women take the cake, although that doe not mean male abuse is acceptable AT ALL. It's never okay to abuse, and laws that encourage too much bias for one gender or the other should be fixed. I think wee can agree on that.   Women are just as likely to not help another woman as a man not to help another man. Women get mad at the rival woman too. It's human nature.   Actually, men jumping into rivers to save women is a leftover from the very old social laws of chivalry, so wouldn't men have died out by now? It might have more to do with the fact that we see someone in need of help, and we tend to believe women are weaker, so men, who are perceived as stronger, come to the rescue because there is the perceived heightened chance for success. If a tiny woman rushes to save a big man, the risk of success decrease. It's about success and gender assumptions. We tend to want to help those weaker than us, if we are inclined to help.   Correlation is not causation, so your suicide stats are not terribly helpful.   You make it sound like men are slaving all day to serve the woman's every whim, and that simply is not so. I know few men who are desperate to ""serve females at all costs"". I know many who do the minimum to meet basic requirements and then a little less. I have seen women do the same.  Perhaps it's true exclusively in the dating scene?   Women are taught to see themselves as less important than their children, and sometimes than their husbands, depending on the views of their local culture. Men are not alone in this challenge. Selflessness only works if both partners are consistently selfless, which is not often the case. Both genders get burned.   Women look at men as tools? Wow.  It may be true of some, but it cannot fairly be universally applied. What an awful lie.  Everyone goes for the ""better offer."" That's just human.   What does this metaphorical gun represent? ""Disarming women"" is a terrifying statement, considering the history of male dominance over women at the state and domestic levels. Are you aware of the basic history of sexism? With your comments, it's like none of that happened, which is a tragic gap in your education.   I agree that seeing other men as brothers is important, and the same should happen for women. Golden rule is always necessary for a civilized society.   It really worries me that you take such an analytic tone and misleading ""evidence"" to make far-fetched arguments. It is alarmist. Men are not going extinct. Do they have challenges? Absolutely, but you are citing the wrong evidence, and blaming women is not helping.   We all take advantage of each other, because we are human. Other men are just as much to blame for a man being held back.   Women are not stealing from men through the State. Stealing is illegal. State aid is not. You assume the entire taxed workforce is male. That is not true. Ask Oprah, Ellen, Martha Stewart, or J.K. Rowling on the other side of the pond, or millions of other working women from fry cooks to corporate executives.    I have enjoyed considering your arguments. Thank you for sharing them. ",1,2014-12-13T22:53:16.000Z,0.018575218476900003,0.39962769752099997,en,nationalgeographic,http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1006_041006_giant_deer.html,False,False

Free will and consciousness are products of the brain. To explain free will, we need to understand how the brain works. The brain transmits electrical and chemical signals through its 100 billions neurons and quadrillion synapses. The Goldman and Nernst equations govern this process of neurotransmission. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postsynaptic_potential These principles are derived from electrochemistry, fluid mechanics and classical electrodynamics. In fact neurotransmission is equivalent to resistance-capacitance circuit in classical electrodynamics. Therefore, it is classical physics not quantum mechanics that governs the brain. Using quantum mechanics to explain free will is like using the theory of relativity in dam engineering. On the other hand: Discovery of quantum vibrations in 'microtubules' inside brain neurons supports controversial theory of consciousness http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm Another interesting argument : Another of Aaronson’s points was that determinism is a two-way street. Our choices can be said to determine the cosmological initial conditions. Therefore even in a fully deterministic universe, we can be said to have free will.

(http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20600-quantum-magic-trick-shows-reality-is-what-you-make-it.html)  Because if idealism is true, if reality is a mental construct, I would expect that experiments would be observer dependent.

What is this based on? I get the impression that this is the ""consciousness of the gaps argument"", which is in some respect similar to the ""god of the gaps argument"". Well, at least consciousness is real but it isn't necessarily the black box that Stephen Barr makes out to be. Like I said before, consciousness is more likely to be just the result of your brain.

This is why Schrodinger developed his thought experiment of the cat and the sample of radioactive substance.

Basically what scientists said was that CFCs usage should be stopped. Policy makers then drew up the Montreal protocol for doing this with the advice of scientists on if it would be enough and would work.  And as a policy advisor it's your job to do that, a scientists isn't a policy advisor. They can only tell you what they found and what your policies would mean in the context of their scientific findings.  Climate shifts can happen for a multiple of reasons. But there's always a forcing involved (in combination with feedbacks) that triggers this. CO2 is at the moment a forcer, which means it's increasing the amount of energy in our climate system, and this energy increase is what tells us how much our world would warm. This is independent of what the cause is for the energy increase or decrease.  This also brings me to you claims of Alley being an alarmist. He's not, he's expressing the findings in the scientific literature. You cannot what thousands of experts have found as alarmist.  And about my lifestyle: again you're making assumptions without even checking if you're correct. I don't have a small apartment; it has 5 rooms. And that's without me counting the kitchen, bathroom, etc.You're also saying things that I already dealt with in the blog post I wrote for you.  Don Easterbrook has been making similar predictions for a while and so far has been wrong every time. He will be wrong again (you're also leaving out a lot what he did predict 2001): http://www.skepticalscience.com/lessons-from-past-climate-predictions-don-easterbrook.html  Again you're making accusation towards me, this time of moving the goalpost. As should be obvious from what I said in the video and in my comments to you: when I'm talking about the 'hiatus' I'm talking about global surface temperatures. The rest what I said is putting that into context and showing that it ignores the bigger picture.  Yes, people deny we are the cause. They are rare, but they are out there. You're also again rejecting what experts say on what will happen. That's not a valid response.  You ignore what happened after it: his results were accepted within a couple of years. Climate science deneirs had decades to make their case yet every time they're proven to be wrong. What you're suggesting is a vast conspiracy to reject valid results. If you had an idea how scientists work and behave you would know that this isn't possible.  Also if you claim that a group is cherry picking you should show that they are doing this. If you can't do this for whatever reason: don't make the accusation. Refusing to do back up such statements doesn't help your case.  Schimdt didn't act like a chicken, as there isn't a debate. The literature shows that the other side is a fringe group that makes claims that isn't supported by the evidence. An immunologist also wouldn't be a chicken if he refused to debate an anti-vaccination proponent.  As I've stated multiple times to you disagreement is allowed. You acknowledge this in your response to me. But those that do get block often break my channel rules in such a manner that comments of them get removed. And they still count towards blocking them. There's a lot more that happened than that is visible on my channel. And by the way, I don't apply this solely to those that are critical towards me. I've also blocked people who are on my side for not playing within my channel rules. There are also example where I warn friends.  What you're trying to do is paint me in a bad light without even bothering to get your facts right. For example, if you had actually fully read my channel rules you would have noticed this: ""When blocked this means you will not be able to participate on my channel for at least one month. At the beginning of each new month I will go through my block list and unblock anyone who was blocked about a month ago. If for some reason your account is not granted access after this period please contact me and I’ll look into the matter.  A block is only permanent when so stated in the block message and if your appeal is rejected. So far this has only happened once when the user in question was impersonating me.""  Because of that part of my block policy the amount of blocked users at the moment is: 0  So again you accused me of something that I don't do and for which I have public records on what my policy is. This alone is a violation of my channel rules and as I've given you several warnings already (which included a final ban warning) I'm going to block you.",0,2014-01-20T06:23:51.000Z,-0.0308639531201,0.576490074966,en,skepticalscience,http://www.skepticalscience.com/lessons-from-past-climate-predictions-don-easterbrook.html,False,False

You could ask: ""And why should it anyway?"", because it is well known that the decay of radionuclides is as reliable as a Swiss clock. Recently, US-American scientists, however, attracted attention when they postulated that the decay rate depends on the flow of solar neutrinos and, thus, also on the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Their assumption was based, among other things, on older measurement data of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). PTB researchers have now definitively refuted the assumption of the Americans.The half-life of radioactive isotopes, i.e. the period in which half of all atomic nuclei have decayed, is regarded as invariably stable. In the case of the carbon isotope 14C, this period amounts, for example, to 5700 years. This property is, among other things, made use of for the dating of archeological findings. There was great excitement when a group of US-American scientists recently published measurement data of the radioactive isotope 36Cl which showed seasonal variations and explained this with the influence of solar neutrinos. All the more since billions of neutrinos from the Sun hit every square centimetre of the Earth every second and remain almost ineffective (they penetrate the Earth as if it weren't there).Scientists of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt have now carried out new measurements and have published their results in the journal ""Astroparticle Physics"". For three years, they checked the activity of samples with 36Cl in order to detect possible seasonal dependencies. Whereas the US-Americans had determined the count rates with gas detectors, PTB used the so-called TDCR liquid scintillation method which largely compensates disturbing influences on the measurements. The result: The measurement results of PTB clearly show fewer variations and do not indicate any seasonal dependence or the influence of solar neutrinos. ""We assume that other influences are much more probable as the reason for the observed variations"", explains PTB physicist Karsten Kossert. ""It is known that changes in the air humidity, in the air pressure and in the temperature can definitively influence sensitive detectors.""Meanwhile, the data of another measurement series − this time for the strontium isotope 90Sr − have been evaluated and submitted for publication. Here too, even sophisticated analyzing methods give no indication of seasonal variations. It can thus be assumed that an influence of solar neutrinos on the radioactive decay does not exist − at least not in the order of magnitude postulated.  Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2014-10-textbook-knowledge-reconfirmed-radioactive-substances.html#jCp",2,2016-03-05T08:56:38.000Z,0.103438606848,0.467035615899,en,phys.org,http://phys.org/news/2014-10-textbook-knowledge-reconfirmed-radioactive-substances.html#jCp,False,False

I'll try to keep my answers as concise as possible.   Regarding the supposed differences, what evidence do you have? -  http://consumersunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Wide-Crosses.pdf  This is just a start but there is far more literature on the difference, if you are speaking purely genetically then I answer than further down (hint: the trans-species genome is unstable)  You might argue that certain individual mutations make food unsafe, but what would your reasoning be behind classifying mutations as safe or unsafe on the basis of an engineered origin?"" - Well I would argue that we don't know the true effects of GE, we are just beginning to understand the complexity of genetic information, so even if we were to insert genes that increased vitamin A in crops instead of producing their own poison like Bt crops we couldn't know the true extent of its benefits or damage until we have long term human feeding studies, the sequences of genes inserted in the overall sequence can have unintended consequences within the human body during digestion that we are completely unaware of. There is nothing definitive yet to my knowledge that makes the mutation unsafe purely on the basis on engineering origin but there is also nothing definitive yet that makes mutations based purely on GE safe, We will truly see the effects of these crops 20-30 years down the line  What distinguishes lab genomes from field genomes, besides the speed with which results are achieved? - The genome inserted in the crop through genetic engineering is unstable, and when cross pollination inevitably occurs, the genome has been shown to insert itself randomly into genetic sequences of other crops causing unintended mutations.   I know nothing about is inherently or objectively wrong with genetic engineering but it's been shown that conventional breeding practices are actually far more effective in creating crops that produce higher yields and drought resistance, and using permaculture practices and soil biome amendments can actually limit pests and weeds by a far greater margin and with less poisonous means that GMO crops.   http://www.nature.com/news/cross-bred-crops-get-fit-faster-1.15940   Regardless of whether you are Pro-GMO or Anti-GMO, I hope we can agree that these should be labeled so people have a right to know what they are eating, and that poisonous herbicides, like round-up, and pesticides should be no where near our food. Now that we have the knowledge and understanding to produce better crops, with less invasive means, more efficiently, without poisons, shouldn't we do it that way?

I didnt cherry pick the two closest years)   Thats an 8-11% difference. 24-29% calories coming from fat is a HIGH FAT diet. All they did was look at a high fat diet compared to a higher fat diet and didnt see any significant differences.  They also said that only total fat was decreased (not satur or trans fat), which means both groups could have been eating the same amount of saturated and trans fats.  For instance ""low fat"" group could eat a steak and a salad, while high fat could eat a steak and salad with half an avocado. Obviously theyre not going to have huge differences in health unless the ""low fat"" group exchanges the steak for an avocado, which I guarantee you they did not. Read the fine print people:  “This study shows that just reducing total fat intake does not go far enough to have an impact on heart disease risk. While the participants’ overall change in LDL “bad” cholesterol was small, we saw trends towards greater reductions in cholesterol and heart disease risk in women eating less saturated and trans fat,” said Jacques Rossouw, M.D., WHI project officer. wait, what was that? LESS SATURATED/TRANS FAT = LESS CHOLESTEROL AND HEART DISEASE  (no sat/trans fat= no heart disease btw (well, as long as you stay away from some other stuff as well))   ""The study also found that following a high-carbohydrate, low-fat eating pattern DOES NOT increase body weight, triglycerides or indicators of increased risk of diabetes such as blood glucose or insulin levels in women.""

Qesem cave has remains from various ages throughout the Pleistocene era, those of anotomically modern humans and neanderthals are of more recent, within the last 200,000 years (most likely 60,000),  while what is said about the older teeth fossils found at the site is ""The Levantine Acheulian assemblages predating the Acheulo-Yabrudian were probably made by Homo erectus"" Science blogger Carl Zimmer wrote: ""Nowhere in this conclusion do the authors say that these teeth belong to Homo sapiens. Nowhere do they say they have just doubled the age of our species. Nowhere do they say that our species evolved in the Near East, not in Africa."" 4. the 340,000 year old paternal lineage thing for africans is likely the result of early mans interbreeding with even earlier homo species in other locations of the african continent, im much the same way that Europeans carry the dna of neanderthals from interbreeding. so the mix with an older species would leave a genetic marker in the dna of modern africans, specifically those in Cameroon tribe where they found multiple cases of that genetic result, located next to a location called Iwo Eleru  were they found the remains of a  man bearing prehistoric and modern human skull features.  https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23240-the-father-of-all-men-is-340000-years-old",0,2016-08-01T09:06:34.000Z,0.06653694479040001,0.427629030026,en,newscientist,https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23240-the-father-of-all-men-is-340000-years-old,False,False
