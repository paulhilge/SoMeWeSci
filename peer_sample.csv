I'm saying that it's an extremely versatile and useful plant. It's not perfect and not everyone tolerates it, and in many of the conditions it's useful in it's by no means a cure. For example with PTSD, vast numbers of sufferers find it to significantly improve their quality of life, but they still have PTSD at the end of the day and need to continue to medicate. That's not a cure, it's a palliative (other psychoactives such as ibogaine, LSD and MDMA are arguably more promising as cures for PTSD in some cases). Many of the most likely benefits of cannabis are in the realm of prevention, for example neuroprotection against Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's. Once the damage has been done it's unlikely that cannabis can reverse it, and trials of cannabinoids in late stage Alzheimer's have not shown improvement, but the literature on prevention or slowing the progression is very promising.  What it comes down to is that inflammation is implicated in nearly every disease, and cannabis has powerful immuno-modulatory effects, which are potentially relevant in nearly every inflammation related condition. That doesn't mean it'll cure any inflammation related condition, but it means it should be investigated in as many as possible, because it appears to be dramatically improving symptoms in some and preventing some others. There have also been studies showing, for example, reduction in traffic fatalities, opioid overdoses and obesity in states which have legalised medicinal marijuana. Even simply partially substituting for alcohol and opioids in people who would otherwise be abusing alcohol and opioids is already enough to be demonstrably saving lives. No estimate has yet been made of what proportion of the population stands to benefit from its anti-inflammatory effects, though I can guarantee that it has helped millions of people and will continue to do so for as long as there are humans.",0,2016-03-24T23:31:45.000Z,0.0731272401434,0.5702060931899999,en,doi,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22740/abstract,False,False

Therefore, iris color might be considered when, evaluating pupillary movements in pupil perimetry.   - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9717650  A blue iris in an eye is due to Tyndall scattering in a turbid layer in the iris. Brown and black irises have the same layer except with more melanin in it. The melanin absorbs light. In the absence of melanin, the layer is translucent (i.e., the light passing through is randomly and diffusely scattered) and a noticeable portion of the light that enters this turbid layer re-emerges via a scattered path. That is, there is backscatter, the redirection of the lightwaves back out to the open air. Scattering takes place to a greater extent at the shorter wavelengths. The longer wavelengths tend to pass straight through the turbid layer with unaltered paths, and then encounter the next layer further back in the iris, which is a light absorber. Thus, the longer wavelengths are not reflected (by scattering) back to the open air as much as the shorter wavelengths are. Since the shorter wavelengths are the blue wavelengths, this gives rise to a blue hue in the light that comes out of the eye.[2][3] The blue iris is an example of a structural color, in contradistinction to a pigment color. The complete absence of pigment in eyes (albinism) causes the eye to appear red, due to the visibility of the red of the retina through the iris.   - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndall_effect",1,2014-03-18T01:12:23.000Z,0.0825268817204,0.30107526881700003,en,pmid,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9717650,False,False

Sodium fluoride, the substance found in toothpaste, is substantially different than fluoride, its LD50 is higher by a factor of thousands of times. Also, not brushing your teeth puts you at an even higher risk for much more likely and dangerous diseases, such as abscessed cavities, where the infection can get into the blood stream and cause sepsis. If you want to go into drinking faucet water, not many people even drink much faucet water without filters (which many filters now remove fluoride). Even if you still must drink from the faucet, you'd have to consume a ton for it to even build up. There's not even any evidence yet that shows that there's any direct effect on the pineal gland (the allegedly most-affected area), just that it tends to accumulate there (even fluoridealert.com admitted to that).

One must ask: _""Are there biological difference between normally developed, according to genetic make-up, xx-chromosome females and xy-chromosome males?""_. If the answer is yes, then we must ask ourselves: _""How do these differences in fetal development come in to play?""_. The answer is chromosomes and hormones, without hormone activation a xy-male wouldn't be able to develop male reproductive organs and to develop the male physiology. Without the testes, and thus the production of testosterone, it's not unfamiliar to see genetic xy-males with xx-female phenotype traits; we all started off as females in the womb, but it's the y-chromosome that induces testicular differentiation[1].   We know for a fact that our endocrine system, and thus hormonal balance, is a key factor in human[2][3], or animal[4][5], behavior. That being said, if androgenic hormones have an influence on behavior, we can safely conclude it has an influence on the male- or female brain; and that there is a difference. The role of academia shouldn't be about treating others as equals, but to provide the individual the tools to cultivate one's ethos, logos and mythos. And to elevate it further to such a degree so that we can have an open dialogue and the ability to reach the same consensus. It's important to respect the individual to understand the students needs, and being male or female is part of that individuals identity - identity is an agreement we make with one another and behavior influences that agreement.   Having open dialogue and free expression of thought is key in developing identity and to elevate our relations with one another. To undermine my expression of thought is to undermine my identity, and that is the biggest crime on the human mind I can think of.

There are dozens more, all of which indicate that vaccines could potentially cause autism. I have read the information on the study hat you proceed before, although I have not seen that specific link, and I do not necessarily believe that the MMR vaccine itself causes autism; but as there are equally reputable studies done that contradict that study specifically, I am not going to dismiss it. Regardless, studies do not prove anything and do not provide hard facts; they are, as a matter of practice in order to get publish, twisted and manipulated in order to support a potential well-selling cognitive bias, often that of the backer. I am sure that your own bias will sway you to dismiss the studies that I just provided you for the same reason; that is fine, I respect it and even expect it. As I have said in every response to this video, there are not enough facts to prove or disprove either side of the vaccine-autism debate. Statistical studies do not provide facts, they provide data: science provides facts (even though science is fallible). But you seem to be missing the point. It is not about what does or doesn't cause autism. It is about saying, ""your cognitive bias is wrong, because it's not based in facts...my bias is correct, even though I can't prove or disprove anything."" Using a controversial debate that has insufficient facts on both sides of the argument to illustrate the science of cognitive bias and THEN saying one of the sides of the debate is wrong displays ignorance of the debate in question, diverts attention away from the science itself, and reveals a lack of self-awareness of one's own hypocrisy in condemning a bias based on facts equally as flimsy their own. Everyone believes that they are the only ones ""in the know"". THAT is the science of cognitive bias. Data and facts are obtained by a a learner/consumer that help them develop their own cognitive bias; then further data turns it into confirmation bias. The ability to dismiss your own cognitive bias in learning is the whole point of the study of cognitive and confirmation bias: it is a branch of science and psychology designed to help us to find the truth. That the presenter of this video has used this specific debate as an example and said one of the sides is wrong is an indication that he missed the whole reason of the psychology and science of cognitive bias, and that he is ignorantly as much of a victim of his own bias as those he condemns. In regards to the vaccine-autism debate, I have no desire to continue this argument with you; we can keep quoting studies back and forth to each other, but without actual facts and science, neither side can be proven. I have provided you with ""facts"" that are just as sufficient as any you would provide me; I know this because I have done research on both sides of the argument, and was actually against anti-vaccination before I performed this research, until I was able to set aside my own bias to perform it properly. I do not have a child with autism; I am not a ""victim of corporate and government lies""; the reason my cognitive bias is currently gently more swayed anti-vaccination than pro-vaccination is because I have actually performed extensive research without allowing my bias to sway me. As I have said, I trust eye-witness accounts more than studies and corporate agenda. If you are interested in learning about this instead of debating, may I suggest that you perform your own research while also successfully dismissing your current bias. If you are interested in debating instead of learning, may I suggest that you would find it more rewarding if you were to educate yourself fully before you take a side of the debate.

Here, a new perspective on climate change causality is presented using the central England temperature (CET) dataset, the longest instrumental temperature record, and a combination of slow feature analysis and wavelet analysis. The driving forces of climate change were investigated and the results showed two independent degrees of freedom —a 3.36-year cycle and a 22.6-year cycle, which seem to be connected to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation cycle and the Hale sunspot cycle, respectively. Moreover, these driving forces were modulated in amplitude by signals with millennial timescales.

We study the long-term variability of a sample of five solar analog stars using composite chromospheric activity records up to 50 years in length and synoptic visible-band photometry about 20 years long. This sample covers a large range of stellar ages which we use to represent the evolution in activity for solar mass stars. We find that young, fast rotators have an amplitude of variability many times that of the solar cycle, while old, slow rotators have very little variability. We discuss the possible impacts of this variability on young Earth and exoplanet climates.

The purpose of this study is to explore the response of extreme precipitation to solar activity and El Nino events in typical regions of the Loess Plateau—a case study in the Yan’an area. The precipitation data was from nine weather stations in Yan’an and the sunspot number and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were from 1951 to 2015. The results show that maximum precipitation occurred mainly at the peak sunspot number or 2a near it and the sunspot number minimum and valley values were not significantly correlated. The results of Morlet wavelet showed that a 41-year period of precipitation was the most obvious within the 64-year scale. Similarly, sunspot number showed a 16-year periodic variability. Correlation analyses of the 16-year and 41-year scales demonstrated that the relationships between precipitation and sunspot number were close. In addition, extreme precipitation often occurred in the year following El Nino events. According to 10-year moving average curves, precipitation generally showed a downward trend when SOI was negative. The results indicate that solar activity and El Nino events had significant impacts on precipitation in typical regions of the Loess Plateau.

That is why it is crucial only medical professionals classify medical conditions.  Therefor no Transsexual is not a deformity.  So no it is not a deformity nor a mental illness. facts are facts.

Kruijver FP1, Zhou JN, Pool CW, Hofman MA, Gooren LJ, Swaab DF.  Graduate School Neurosciences Amsterdam, The Netherlands Institute for Brain Research.  F.Kruijver@nih.knaw.nl  Transsexuals experience themselves as being of the opposite sex, despite having the biological characteristics of one sex.  A crucial question resulting from a previous brain study in male-to-female transsexuals was whether the reported difference according to gender identity in the central part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) was based on a neuronal difference in the BSTc itself or just a reflection of a difference in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide innervation from the amygdala, which was used as a marker. Therefore, we determined in 42 subjects the number of somatostatin-expressing neurons in the BSTc in relation to sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and past or present hormonal status.  Regardless of sexual orientation, men had almost twice as many somatostatin neurons as women (P < 0.006).  The number of neurons in the BSTc of male-to-female transsexuals was similar to that of the females (P = 0.83).  In contrast, the neuron number of a female-to-male transsexual was found to be in the male range.  Hormone treatment or sex hormone level variations in adulthood did not seem to have influenced BSTc neuron numbers. The present findings of somatostatin neuronal sex differences in the BSTc and its sex reversal in the transsexual brain clearly support the paradigm that in transsexuals sexual differentiation of the brain and genitals may go into opposite directions and point to a neurobiological basis of gender identity  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391851 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375171 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195418 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094885 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402034/  https://lizdaybyday.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/mtf_brain_scan_differences.png  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4261554/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20646177 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26556015  https://youtu.be/A3C4ZJ7HyuE",0,2017-05-06T13:51:42.000Z,0.11858974359,0.428846153846,en,pmc,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4261554/,True,False

Paper #1 is over 10 years old and had a n=20, and all the patients were already obese.  The study sites increased arachadonic inflammatory marker but does not postulate causation for this.  Emotional distress is not uncommon in obese people when they undergo dietary changes, especially when they are under strict control.  I think this study is not able to back up the conclusions it makes.  #2 doesn't give us a n but it again compares obese/morbidly obese patients over 6 weeks with very little to no difference in weight loss, which over 6 weeks is not surprising  in morbidly obese patients.  This study does note increased insulin reduction in the very low carb diets, which is a clear advantage for those in danger of DM2.  Again, this study is over 10 years old.  #4 notes very minor changes in athletic performance, which would probably only be noticeable in elite athletes.  The mean BMI in that study is 23 so you're already talking about fit people who may not have needed the ability to efficiently mobilize fat stores if they were already lean.  On the flip side,  consider this recent study that compared obese patients on a ketogenic diet vs. low calorie: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584583  This one had a 12 month follow up and not only did the keto diet lose more weight, they kept it off for longer.  This recent study showed that keto diet helped with fat loss but preserved lean muscle mass: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27754807  So did this one: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27383313  What I'm offering is that there IS evidence that keto is not only effective but in some cases superior to low calorie for weight loss and maintenance.  And please site the study that links low carb diets to low testosterone.  Testosterone is synthesized from cholesterol which we make endogenously and obtain via diet in eating animal fats.  The enzymes that catalyze this reaction are not based on carb intake.

Remember that ""before present"" (BP) in paleoclimatology means ""before 1950"":  ""20th Century back to 795,000 years Before Present (B.P.) (Before 1950)."" http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/atm_meth/ice_core_methane.html  potholer54 covered this point is a previous video: ""7. Climate Change - ""Those"" e-mails and science censorship"", from around the 2 minute mark  So your source's graphs that go ""before present"" do not show increased Arctic ice up to the present moment of 2017. In fact, your own source says that it is not examining shorter-term, greenhouse-gas-induced (GHG-induced) changes in Arctic ice levels:  ""Results from e.g. 2 × CO2 experiments are however not directly comparable to this study where we look at insolation variations on multi-millennial time scales rather than increased GHG forcing on much shorter time scales."" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113004162?np=y   And your source clearly says:  ""Our work points to the strong surface albedo feedback as the common denominator between the sea ice minimum before 6000 years ago and the present diminishing trend. However, at the same time as our simulations show the importance of the surface albedo feedback, there are likely two distinctly different underlying causes for the feedback to kick in: increased insolation (past) and *increased GHG [greenhouse gases] levels (present).""* http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113004162?np=y   Thus your source acknowledges that greenhouse gases are causing the positive feedback that's amplifying current global warming and causing current Arctic sea ice loss. This, of course, is consistent with other research on this subject. For example:  ""Observational determination of albedo decrease caused by vanishing Arctic sea ice"" ""Estimating the global radiative impact of the sea ice–albedo feedback in the Arctic"" ""The central role of diminishing sea ice in recent Arctic temperature amplification"" ""Surface air temperature variability and trends in the Arctic: new amplification assessment and regionalisation""   So, PDR, you once again show that you neither read nor understand the scientific research you cite. *And I expect that you'll evade the points I just made, as is your usual dishonest practice.* Let's see you confirm my prediction. :)   Your problem, PDR, is that you continue to pretend that past climate change must have the same causes as current climate change. That's a ridiculous idea for you to have. Past non-anthropogenic climate change doesn't change the fact that most of the recent global warming was caused by humans through the production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. To say otherwise is as ridiculous as saying that humans can't cause forest fires now, since humans didn't cause a forest fire that occurred hundreds of years ago:  ""These examples illustrate that different climate changes in the past had different causes. The fact that natural factors caused climate changes in the past does not mean that the current climate change is natural. By analogy, the fact that forest fires have long been caused naturally by lightning strikes does not mean that fires cannot also be caused by a careless camper."" https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-6-1.html  ""Critics have argued that, if temperatures were as warm or warmer than current conditions before the onset of anthropogenic forcing, this would provide evidence that “natural” fluctuations alone could explain current conditions, since greenhouse gases were only ~280 ppmv during Medieval time (versus 400 ppmv today). [...] With the increase in irradiance and a decline in explosive volcanism in the early 20th century, global temperatures might then have returned to an unperturbed level similar to that of the MQP [Medieval Quiet Period], but *the rapid rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gases propelled temperatures well beyond that level, as positive anthropogenic radiative forcing overwhelmed natural variability (Myhre et al., 2013).""* https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291523102_The_Medieval_Quiet_Period",2,2017-06-06T19:57:44.000Z,0.014511800984399999,0.368822273617,en,others,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113004162,False,False

It significantly reduced the body weight and body mass index of the patients. Furthermore, it decreased the level of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and blood glucose, and increased the level of HDL cholesterol. Administering a ketogenic diet for a relatively longer period of time did not produce any significant side effects in the patients. Therefore, the present study confirms that it is safe to use a ketogenic diet for a longer period of time than previously demonstrated.  So the conclusion they draw says the Keto diet is dangerous? Do you ascribe different meanings to words in english than most of the world?  and another from a study you cite (did you even read these?) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555979/pdf/pone.0055030.pdf) :  Conclusion: Low-carbohydrate diets were associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality and they were not significantly associated with a risk of CVD mortality and incidence. However, this analysis is based on limited observational studies and large-scale trials on the complex interactions between low-carbohydrate diets and long-term outcomes are needed.  Observational studies (if you know anything about scientific studies) are THE WORST type of study for trying to determine causation, they are very often entirely wrong (which is why vegans often lose their arguments from science because most vegan ""science"" is observational). They admit that there needs to be more study and nothing was conclusive, so you can't really point to a study like that as evidence that something is bad, unless you are a disingenuous ideologue spouting tired dogma.  You lost me at vegan. You define yourself by what you eat (which is a bit sad), so you may be slightly biased. Can you provide any cultures at any time of history more than 100 year ago that were successful vegans? I am sure my comment will be downgraded but this video says the exact opposite (with many studies as well) of many Keto/Paleo videos, how can anyone be certain they are right?",290,2017-02-13T05:59:25.000Z,0.0545068027211,0.504682539683,en,pmc,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555979/pdf/pone.0055030.pdf,False,False

I appreciate that you put your Pubmed links in the description! :)  Second of all, unfortunately I am a bad carnivore person, but your channel really enlightens me on the advantages of adopting the vegan diet and when I'll be in my apartment, I'll probably adopt this lifestyle :)  I just have a few questions though, I don't know if you will answer them, but I'll at least ask them :)  1. How do vegans replenish their creatine reserves found in red meat? Do they bypass to the glycogen system when doing a physical activity?  2. Why vegan more than vegetarian? Do you get the same health benefits from turning vegetarian?  3. Is a vegan diet less expensive than an omnivore's diet?   4. Let's say the answer to question #1 is ""they can't replenish their creatine reserves"". Do vegans have special training methods to couter this?  5. Are there any downsides of having a vegan diet?   6. I am also studying on the source of the growing Gluten problem (especially NCGS). I found a link between Gluten sensibility and the Roundup Ready herbicide. Should this be considered in a vegan diet? Considering you will eat whole plant foods and that the main used herbicide is Roundup Ready, shown to have a myriad of negative effects on the intestine, I'm guessing you will get a lot of Roundup in your food :S  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052523)  7.

This high percentage of individuals having long term immunity has been compromised by mass vaccination of children which provides at best 70 to 90% immunity that is temporary and of unknown duration—shifting chickenpox to a more vulnerable adult population where chickenpox carries 20 times more risk of death and 15 times more risk of hospitalization compared to children. Add to this the adverse effects of both the chickenpox and shingles vaccines as well as the potential for increased risk of shingles for an estimated 30 to 50 years among adults.

Diet and lifestyle play an important role in preventing and reversing heart disease, and certain herbs and supplements can help lower your risk for heart disease, and treat heart conditions you've already been diagnosed with.  Here are several herbs and supplements that will help in fighting atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of most heart disease. Atherosclerosis causes plaque to build up in your arteries, blocking the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart, and other organs. It can cause a heart attack and even death. Atherosclerosis is common in the developed world, but virtually unknown outside of it, due to the different diets and lifestyles of people in developing countries.   1. Plant-Based, Anti-inflammatory Diet.  Incorporating as many alkaline foods as possible into your daily diet, will reverse the inflammation that stems from an acidic diet...

Mir ist jedoch eine Sache aufgefallen, die durchaus das Potenzial für falsche Schlussfolgerungen bietet. Du gehst nicht an einer Stelle auf die biologischen Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern ein. Am deutlichsten wird das an dem Punkt im Video, an dem du über Geschlechtsunterschiede im Verhalten bei Kleinkindern sprichst (4:13).  Unterschied im Verhalten zwischen den Geschlechtern, die wir bereits bei Kleinkindern finden, können nicht durch gesellschaftliche Faktoren beeinflusst sein, da wir diese Effekte bereits kurz nach der Geburt feststellen können. Hier kann noch keine Sozialisation stattgefunden haben. Zusätzlich finden wir vergleichbare Geschlechterunterschiede im Verhalten auch bei unseren nächsten Verwandten, nämlich verschiedenen Affen-Spezies. Ich habe hier mal ein paar Studien zusammengetragen:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583786/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704567/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4726418/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424807/  Vor allem bei Affen können wir als Gründe für die unterschiedlichen Verhaltensweisen einen Einfluss von Gesellschaft und Kultur nahezu vollständig ausschließen. Daher müssen Unterschiede im z.B. Spielverhalten zwischen Männchen und Weibchen durch biologische (d.h. zum Beispiel Hormone) ausgelöst werden.   Und hier fängt die interessante Frage ja eigentlich erst an: Ist das, was wir heute in unserer Gesellschaft als Geschlechterrollen und -stereotypen sehen können, ein ""selbstgemachtes Problem"" oder sind unsere Gesellschaft und unsere Kultur nur ein Spiegel der biologischen Voraussetzungen, die Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich machen. Feedbackloops sind hier natürlich anzunehmen, aber genau aus dem Grund ist es wichtig, bei der Biologie für eine Ursachenerklärung anzufangen und nicht ""mittendrin"" bei sozialen/gesellschaftlichen Faktoren anzufangen.",20,2016-07-28T18:24:17.000Z,0.0,0.0,de,pmc,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704567/,False,False

Do some people over-simplify the issue? Do some people over-complicate it? C0nc0rdance seems to think that FGC is very cut-and-dried: it’s an all-round bad thing! This despite the many different forms of FGC (some similar to or even less severe than standard male circumcision) and the various reasons used to justify it (all of which are used for MGC also).   For someone like myself (and obviously many others), routine infant circumcision is a very simple issue: just don’t do it. It’s his body, his penis, his choice. He has the right to experience his sexuality in its most natural and complete form. If he wants to change that (or anything else about his body) then he can. (Most people don’t.) There is no good reason to deny him that right and to subject him to unnecessary pain, risk and loss.   None of the arguments for RIC stand up to reason. The only possible reasons that may complicate the issue are: (1) religion (if you are devoutly Jewish or Muslim), and (2) HIV (if you live in a place with a very high HIV rate). I say these situations *may* complicate the issue (that is arguable). Yet neither of these issues apply to C0nc0rdance or the majority of people. (They don’t even apply to the majority of Jews!)   (2) “I’ve read several reviews of the topic by bio-ethicists and none of them see this as a polar issue - a black-and-white topic.”   Who are these bio-ethicists? What do they say exactly? What dimension/s of the subject are they addressing? (Religious? Medical? Social? Sexual? Ethical?) Are they circumcised or from circumcising cultures? What about other bio-ethicists?   (3) “This is the real world. Condom use has not, so far, been completely effective at ending STDs. Neither has hygiene prevented UTIs.”   STDs and UTIs are not major problems. The data on circumcision and STDs is mixed. Circumcision appears to provide some protective effect against some STDs but not others. This study found no difference between circumcised and intact in STD transmission: www.cirp.org/library/general/richters1/.   The only STD that can allegedly kill someone is HIV, which seems quite hard to contract through heterosexual contact according to the following study: http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/146/4/350.full.pdf. Other STDs are not lethal, and although they may be unpleasant, most can be prevented with condoms and hygiene and cured with antibiotics. Infants don’t have sex so it is perfectly reasonable to let grown men decide for themselves if they wish to have part of their penis removed or simply practice safe sex and personal hygiene and receive appropriate treatment if necessary. (This is, after all, how we treat girls.)  Circumcision is only touted to help prevent UTIs in the first year of life. The evidence for this claim has been strongly criticised. (www.circumstitions.com/Utis.html) Even if it were true, so what? Again, UTIs may be unpleasant but most are readily curable with antibiotics. Girls get far more UTIs than boys but no one suggests circumcising them. Many UTIs in intact boys may be the result of improper care from ignorant care-givers, including many doctors and nurses in circumcising societies like the USA. If a study has not properly controlled for this then it is flawed. If a boy has recurrent treatment-resistant UTIs then (conservative) circumcision is a treatment option. In that case the surgery becomes *therapeutic*.  “This is not a trivial problem and saying the solution is simple is to ignore the deaths that the complexity of the real world causes. If circumcision could save a few million lives that education alone cannot, I for one will not stand in the way of global public health efforts to save lives.”  What does this even mean? Talk about “pathos”! He must be talking about HIV because other STIs and UTIs are not lethal. HIV seems to be his only real argument. An analysis of this argument is presented here: www.circumstitions.com/HIV.html.   Let us assume that circumcision has a significant protective effect against HIV. It is then arguably a beneficial public health measure in a location with a very high rate of heterosexually-transmitted HIV. Of course, if FGC were demonstrated to have a similar effect then it could also be used. In fact, if removing a particular body-part were shown to have a significant protective effect against some disease in an area of high prevalence, it could arguably be used. But this does present an ethical question of rights of the individual vs. public health policy. This question is raised regarding vaccination.   Thankfully, most people don’t live in areas with high rates of heterosexually-transmitted HIV so C0nc0rdance’s argument has very limited application. It certainly doesn’t apply to his son (or anyone in the developed world, for that matter).  (4) “Circumcision is not like removing arms to prevent arm cancer.”  Again, the principle is the same: surgical removal of a body-part in an attempt to prevent anything going wrong with that part.   “The best analogy I could think of to match the risks and benefits is the removal of tonsils. I’m not sure I would be comfortable if infant tonsil removal were a routine practice but if it were part of the culture I lived in it would be a lot harder for me to see it as barbaric and mutilation.”  I think this statement is very telling. It really seems that C0nc0rdance sees little difference between tonsillectomy and circumcision. He really doesn’t seem to appreciate that the penis is a sex organ and the foreskin may have sexual functions, including sensation. At least he admits (in a very round-about way) that his cultural conditioning has biased him against seeing the dark side of “circumcision” (infant male genital cutting), even if that conditioning originated from sinister motivations.   “I’d be much more likely to rely on the medical costs and benefits and the ethics involved than on an emotional appeal to intact tonsils.”  The purpose of keeping a child “intact” is manifold: (1) It respects the child's body and sovereign right over the body, (2) It avoids subjecting a child to unnecessary pain and risk, (3) In the case of amputations or extractions (“ectomies”), it avoids removing a healthy functional body-part that many/most people find useful or beneficial. Tonsils have functions and so do foreskins. Unfortunately C0nc0rdance will never experience the latter.   “Please note that very young children do not participate in the decision to have a tonsillectomy; their parents make the decision for them as the legal guardian.   Very young children don’t participate in the decision to have any necessary surgery. So what? We’re not talking about legitimately therapeutic circumcision.   “If parents chose to have a preventative tonsillectomy for their child, the analogy would be pretty close and that would also be a complex issue.”   Routine tonsillectomies are no longer performed. Such a procedure should also arguably be illegal. Routine tonsillectomies were once performed, as was routine circumcision in many places that no longer practice it. So were lobotomies and clitoridectomies performed on children once upon a time.   FGC is a much better comparison than tonsillectomy because it is surgery or cutting to the genitals of children. You can compare removal of homologous structures: the prepuce of both sexes. The clitoral hood (female prepuce) is actually part of the inner labia (labia minora) and, because it is significantly smaller in the female, you could extend the comparison to removal of the inner labia as well. You could even arguably extend the comparison to removal of some of the clitoris as the foreskin is much more highly innervated than the clitoral hood and inner labia, and actually contains the penile g-spot (the frenulum), which can be partially or wholly ablated by circumcision.   Furthermore, FGC and MGC have similar histories and motivations. (Although MGC is far more prevalent in today’s world, every culture that practices any form of FGC also practices MGC. Even the USA used to practice FGC to a limited degree.)   I wonder, would C0nc0rdance seriously consider removing any part of his daughter’s genitalia for any reason other than medical emergency or necessity? I seriously doubt it.",0,2016-01-30T00:47:34.000Z,0.0496462051389,0.46709621095799997,en,others,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/146/4/350.full.pdf.,False,False

He also states that Talk Origins misrepresents the “facts”. Throughout this video he constantly refers to the facts however he never makes it quite clear what facts he is talking about. From 1:00 to 2:06, AbusiveAntiTheist (AAT) explains what ERVs are and explains that the animals we are closely related to share more of the same ERVs than animals we are not closely related to. OFNF then concedes that AAT’s explanation would be reasonable if evolution were true. Obviously, OFNF does not consider evolution true. Keep in mind that the explanation AAT gave in this video is an explanation showing that organisms that are closely related will have more similarities than organisms that are less related. Also, keep in mind how vague the notion that “many similarities between organisms indicate that they are closely related while fewer similarities between animals indicate that they are less closely related” is. Though this notion is a very, very, very rudimentary notion used in regards to evolution, it is not specific as the more complicated reasoning behind the theory of evolution. OFNF attacks this extremely vague notion and uses his criticism of the notion to attack the whole theory of evolution. This is a clear example of straw-manning a position if there ever was one. This will be made clear later on. At 3:30 he makes a distinction between the facts and the interpretation of the facts. He concedes that there are many similarities between organisms at 3:36. However, he does not concede that the fact that animals have similarities implies that animals who share many similarities are closely related. In fact, he states that such an assumption is merely an interpretation of the fact that organisms possess many similarities. He seems to believe that the phylogenetic tree is based solely on the vague assumption that the more similarities that animals have then the more they are related while the less similarities animals have between each other indicates that they are less related. However, he never elaborates on what he means by “similarities” and he never elaborates on what specific animals he is talking about until later on. Well, he sort of elaborates later on. He also claims that “evolutionists” only teach one side of the story as if there is some sort of valid alternative to evolution in the discipline of biology. He also claims that “evolutionists” go through great lengths to ban the controversy regarding evolution from being taught in the class room. He also states that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence while keeping contrary evidence out of the class room. He again states that the “facts” state otherwise. At this point this is where we sort of get into the details. OFNF goes on to cite an article titled “Rewriting Evolution: Tiny molecules called microRNAs are tearing apart traditional ideas about the animal family tree.” as an example of “evolutionists” ignoring contrary evidence. Humorously, he highlights the part of the title that states that microRNA is changing the order of the family tree of evolution yet ignores that the title implies that evolution will still be true being that the title says that evolution is being rewritten and not being shown to be false. He then quotes a part of the article which includes molecular paleobiologist at Dartmouth College, Kevin Peterson’s own words.   “’I’ve looked at thousands of microRNA genes, and I can’t find a single example that would support the traditional tree,” he says. The technique “just changes everything about our understanding of mammal evolution’.”   Here we see another sign of the inconsistency of OFNF’s reasoning. Earlier in the video he stated that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence to evolution yet OFNF cites Peterson (someone he considers an evolutionist) that deals directly with evidence that OFNF considers contrary to evolution. The rest of the article cites other evolutionists who are not ignoring what OFNF considers contrary evidence. This is a tad bit hilarious. He claims that evolutionists are ignoring contrary evidence yet cites a whole article of “evolutionists” not ignoring the very data that OFNF feels is contrary to evolution.  Even funnier is that nothing in the article is contrary to evolution. The article states that Peterson’s findings are contrary to the traditional evolutionary branches on the evolutionary tree yet Peterson’s evidence still supports an evolutionary tree. For example, the article OFNF cites shows a picture of a side-by-side comparison of the traditional evolutionary tree of placental mammals and Kevin Peterson’s evolutionary tree of placental mammals on the PDF of the article. What OFNF fails to communicate is that the two different branches in the side-by-side comparison still show that placental mammals are still a closely related family on their own branch no matter which branch is correct on this side-by-side comparison. Essentially, it is the order and placement of twigs on the branch that is in question. It is not evolution that is in question. Peterson’s evidence is still in support of evolution. OFNF’s claim that there is controversy within the biological community is overstated. If anything the article is great news because it shows that we are improving our understanding of biological evolution. If Peterson is right then we will only make the theory of evolution a stronger theory. If Peterson is wrong then it still makes the theory of evolution a stronger theory. It is a win-win situation being that Peterson’s evidence supports evolution anyways. However, Peterson’s data has not yet been confirmed as the article states.   At 5:06 OFNF continues on to state that in order to get published in peer-reviewed scientific journals one’s results have to line up with the theory of evolution regardless if your data is irrefutable. According to OFNF, if your data doesn’t line up with evolution then your work doesn’t get published and people will have a bias against you. OFNF then supports his assertion by quote mining the article at 5:21. Quote:   “At first, Peterson and Sempere had a tough time publishing their results suggesting that animals had accumulated regulatory microRNAs. ‘One of the reviewers said it was impossible, what we were describing,’ says Peterson.”   OFNF seems to gloss over the two sentences right after the quote he cites that states that Peterson’s papers were eventually published.   “In the end, the work was published in a specialized zoology journal. Subsequent papers, however, won over some sceptics and Peterson was soon publishing in Nature and Science”   Keep in mind that Nature and Science are very prestigious and mainstream science journals that did not ignore Peterson’s findings.   Furthermore, Peterson’s papers were not initially rejected because his data did not align with the theory of evolution. His data was rejected because it was brand new data that has never been seen at the time, period. This is how science works. New data must survive tons of scrutiny before getting published so as to maintain a high standard within the discipline. Sometimes new data gets rejected a few times when going through the peer-review process before finally gaining acceptance. The peer-review process is exactly how Newton and Einstein’s findings gained acceptance. Their findings were scrutinized and sometimes rejected but soon gained acceptance. Peterson’s findings gained acceptance the same way. OFNF then states that creationists have their own scientific journals because of this alleged bias. However, it is clear that OFNF is wrong. He then quotes the same article but only quotes those that disagree with Peterson’s findings. OFNF does not show you the quotes that show that not everyone in the same field as Peterson disagrees with Peterson. After all, Peterson would not have been able to get published if no one agreed with him. Nonetheless, here’s a quote from the same article OFNF quote mines that shows that others agree with Peterson’s microRNA findings:    “That has won him many critics, but also some strong supporters. ‘Peterson and his col­leagues have demonstrated that microRNAs are a powerful tool in determining the rela­tionships of major animal groups,’ says Derek Briggs, director of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, Connecticut.”       Elsewhere in the article, evolutionary bioinformatician, Peter Stadler agrees:   “‘It is a really clever and fresh approach to phylogeny,’ says Peter Stadler, an evolutionary bioinformatician at the University of Leipzig in Germany. ‘I don’t quite know why pres­ence/absence of microRNAs is not used more frequently in deep phylogeny approaches.’”   It is clear that scientists are divided on this matter and it is clear that the matter is a work in progress as the article indicates.   OFNF then quotes an abstract of a paper entitled the “Gene tree discordance, phylogenetic inference and the multispecies coalescent”. This is a sophomore move from OFNF. A simple Wikipedia search will show that abstracts are very limited and that the full article should be consulted. Consulting an abstract alone is inadequate when trying to get the full picture. Based on what OFNF quoted from the abstract, Wikipedia is actually right. What OFNF forgiven quoted from the abstract is not very specific at all. At 6:48 OFNF quotes from the abstract stating:   “…conflicting genealogical histories often exist in different genes throughout the genome…resolving close species relationships is not quite as simple as applying more data to the problem.”   From these two statements and a small quote from the article OFNF claims that the article shows genetic trees are different depending on what set of genetic data one looks at but he does not elaborate to what extent the trees are changed. Is the entire evolutionary tree different such that bees fall on a twig on the evolutionary branch of placental mammals or are the differences in genetic trees minor such that tiny twigs of closely related species fall on different places of slightly bigger twig but still strongly support the theory of evolution? OFNF never elaborates on this. However, the abstract OFNF quotes states that resolving [close] species relationships is not simple which indicates that the major branches on the evolutionary tree are well confirmed but it is the minute details of the twigs on this tree which needs further investigation and refining. In other words, the evolutionary tree has been demonstrated. At 8:10, OFNF cites the paper titled “Mapping Human Genetic Ancestry” (http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/10/2266.full.pdf+html), and uses the paper to argue against evolution. The paper does state that human evolution is not entirely certain but the paper does state that human evolution did occur. It is also certain that the great apes are closely related and share a common ancestor as is shown in table 2 and 3 of the paper. The paper also doesn’t ignore the incongruent data. The paper actually addresses the data directly and admits to the incongruent data though OFNF ignores that while once again falsely claiming that contrary data is ignored. It seems like it is OFNF that is ignoring the data. OFNF also states that phylogenetic trees cannot be used to prove the family tree but he fails to realize that they are one in the same. He also fails to realize that the family tree cannot be proven because new data can always turn up which could change current phylogeny (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/phylogenetics_05). In fact, no science is ever proven exactly because new data can always change current scientific knowledge. All scientific theories are tentative so it is nonsensical for OFNF to ask for the family tree to be proven. The evolutionary tree has already been demonstrated anyways. At 9:38 OFNF quotes the article with Kevin Peterson once again and asserts that AAT is only paying attention to what conforms to AAT’s supposedly preconceived notion that the theory of evolution is correct a priori. However, I have already shown how OFNF has grossly misrepresented the article which renders his charge against ATT superfluous. OFNF then moves on to talk about ERVs but OFNF doesn’t just talk about ERVs, he grossly misrepresents what ERVs tell us about evolution. OFNF argues that it is very likely that chimps and humans would share identical ERV sites while still acquiring ERV cites independently because there are so many cites (~30,000) in human DNA and ERV cites do not occur in random spots. Even granting OFNFs constraints, his argument still does not explain why only specific species share the same exact ERV cites that others do not. For instance, the HERV-K insertion is only shared among various primates. Also, small cats (e.g. the jungle cat, European wildcat, African wildcat, blackfooted cat, and domestic cat) under the family Felidae all share a specific retrogene insertion not found in any other carnivore. Is OFNF going to argue that the matching EVR insertions that are exclusive to primates occurred independently for each primate species but match up perfectly by coincidence? How about the ERV insertion that small cats in the Felidae family share? Did that insertion occur independently of every species in that group but just happens to match up perfectly while that same insertion is completely absent from all other animals? I think not. Clearly, he is just trying to discredit evolution even if his objections make no sense. Given that ERVs are only passed down to descendants it is clear that animals that share ERVs are related and small groups of different species that exclusively share ERVs all share common ancestry. Basically, ERVs do support evolution despite OFNF’s objections in this video.

They are certainly accurate for the applications that the average person would give you, but they don't have specific scientific definitions that are less ambiguous.  --  You wrote - ""But it doesn't matter, you lost this portion of the debate in your first response, wings, flippers, fins they serve a precise purpose, you already acknowledged that.""  I did NOT acknowledge that.

I would agree that all of those serve more than one function, which means that, by definition, they are not specially designed.  --  You FINALLY asked, ""...what 'Lexicon' do you have that disputes what I said?""  I didn't say any of them did. You just chose one that only had colloquial definitions. There are dictionaries that also have more context-specific definitions. For example, The Oxford English Language Dictionary defines ""Selection"" as you do, but additionally adds these contexts:  1.1 - select for/against (in terms of evolution) determine whether (a characteristic or organism) will survive.  1.2 - Use a mouse or keystrokes to mark (something) on a computer screen for a particular operation.  There are several other academic dictionaries that you could easily consult.  --  You wrote - ""BTW, Penguins don't use their wings as wings, they are just like the Ostrich, their wings are not used for the same purpose as wings on a Hawk.""  So they are NOT specially designed for flight. Well done. You're catching up.  --  You wrote - ""wings on a Penguin are used as flippers, they a used specifically for that purpose.""  You're going to have to make your mind up here. Are wings specially designed for flight as you said? Are flippers required for acquatic life? In the case of the penguin, no to both questions.  --  You wrote - ""I stand by my comment, wings are pretty much useless in the water.""  Except in the case of penguins.  --  You wrote - ""Penguins don't even live in water, the only go in for food, this means that a Penguin's 'wings' are a specialty that helps them hunt food.""  Now you're moving the goalpost AND contradicting yourself.  --   You wrote - ""You can repeat all you want that natural selection isn't random, but if you make that argument, you're saying the changes are intentional...""  No. Only you are making that false dichotomy fallacy.  --  You wrote - ""Many argue that evolution is the way god did it, evolution could be the way a god did it, but if that's the case, it was intelligence that created natural selection.""  And that refutes evolution how?  --   You wrote - ""What proof do you have that wings and/or fins developed from the same homologous structures?""  1. ""Proof"" is a mathematic and legal concept. Science deals with evidence, not proof.  2. If you want ""proof"" of common descent, the genetic test we use to determine relationship between species is the very same genetic test we use to legally determine relationship between people. There you have it. Legal proof of common descent.  3. Getting back to science, here is my evidence: In 1996, a french team led by Catherine Ramain published their experiments with mouse genes. They discovered that switching of the HOX A 13 and HOX D 13 genes prevented the development of limbs from the ankle down, implying that the HOX genes were responsible for the development of digits. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25980463  Building on that, in 2013, Tetsuya Nakamura inserted random DNA into the analogous HOX genes in zebra fish. This insertion caused a frame-shift and, thereby, jumbled up the genes. The result was that these ray-finned fishes developed fins without rays. https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19322  And confirming this, Andrew R. Gehrke also conducted a parallel experiment engineering the zebrafish to emit a glow from every protein catalyzed by the two HOX genes. When compared to the appendages in mice using the same technique, Gehrke noticed that the HOX gene is responsible for both, digits and rays. This was published in the August 17th, 2016 issue of the journal Nature. http://www.pnas.org/content/112/3/803.abstract and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360378/  Even if evolution is wrong, it still predicted these homologies ahead of time. Remind me what discovery was ever made by assuming a six-day creation event 6,000 years ago.  --  You wrote - ""That isn't a fact, it's conjecture.""  Actually. It's neither. It is a deduction that was made by applying the theory and then testing its predictions. Something creationism can't do.  --  You wrote - ""To know such a development would be deadly requires intelligence.  How does natural selection know what ""death"" means?""  If you're dead, there is nothing for natural selection to act upon. Are you serious?  --  You wrote - ""...only through intelligence can we say, 'don't do that, it will kill you!'  Not evolving a trait indicates the process is not random, but rather a guided process.""  You have got to be shitting me! Are you seriously telling me you think natural selection is an intelligence giving the body advice? I refuse to continue this conversation unless you can prove to me that you actually know what natural selection is.  --  You wrote - ""If natural selection says do this or don't do that, it's a clear sign that intelligence is involved.""  It says no such thing and has no such intelligence. If you don't live to reproduce, you are selected against. It is a fact. If you reproduce quite frequently, you are selected for. There is no intelligence that makes that decision, it is a consequence of your reproductive success.  --  You wrote - ""There is no possible way that natural selection could stop a wing from evolving without knowledge that it would be a disadvantage because it has no brain, no ability to think and reason, no ability to plan, or direct the process of evolution.""  I never said it did. It is simply a fact that if you grow flippers instead of legs and live on land, you're going to have a hard time reproducing and you probably will not have descendants carrying your flipper genes. An intelligence is not necessary for that fact to be true, but that fact is known as natural selection.  --  You wrote - ""If your brain was removed from your head you couldn't do anything, you couldn't even live, and natural selection could not do what is claimed it does with a brain of it's own, so where is natural selection's brain?""  It is simply a fact that if your brain was removed from your head, you're going to have a hard time reproducing and you probably will not have descendants carrying any of your genes. An intelligence is not necessary for that fact to be true, but that fact is known as natural selection.  --  You wrote - ""To do what we're told...""  Nobody is telling you to do anything. It is a fact that if you do something stupid that gets you killed, you are removed from the genepool. There is no intelligence removing you, but that fact is known as natural selection.  --  You wrote - ""Tell me one thing that isn't an accident or planned.""  A volcano erupting is, neither, an accident nor planned.  --  You wrote - ""To conclude, I know exactly what I disputing, I knew it well enough to earn my Bachelor of Science degree.""  1. You've actually shown, on an astounding level, that you don't know what you're disputing. 2. You'll notice that, at no point, have I ever cited anyone's credentials as evidence for anything. I haven't even cited my own. You, however, are under the impression that a bachelor degree in an unspecified area of study should be noted when, as a creationist, you've already rejected the professional opinions of over 95% of all scientists working in every related field, most of whom are doctors.  --   You wrote - ""...if our little chat were scored as a debate, you would lose.""

No hay que olvidar que esto es una nueva HIPÓTESIS filogenética, no es la verdad absoluta. 2. Basan su estudio en taxones basales del Triásico y principios del Jurásico, cuando muchas de las características que definen a los grupos dentro de Dinosauria aún no estaban definidas por completo y eso resulta en ambigüedades. 3. Herrerasaurus posee las características generales del cráneo terópodo. 4. No incluyen ornitisquios basales, como Kulindadromeus (que tiene estructuras filamentosas) y sin duda aportaría datos relevantes a la hipótesis.  5. No incluyen en su análisis al sauropodomorfo más basal Buriolestes schultzi, el cual es considerado un Sauropodomorpha y su inclusión en su análisis filogenético modifica la filogenia tradicional de Saurischia (Cabreira et al, 2016). 6. Eoraptor, considerado un Sauropodomorpha basal (Sereno et al., 2013) es excluido en su análisis de Sauropodomorpha, y por ende de Saurischia, cuando en otros análisis es considerado tal (e.g. Martinez y Alcober, 2009; Martinez et al., 2011; Nesbitt y Ezcurra, 2015). 7. Existe un ejemplar de saurópodo juvenil (Barosaurus), al cual se le atribuyen evidencias de un sistema de sacos de aire (Melstrom et al., 2016), algo que sólo los terópodos no-avianos y avianos tienen. Lo anterior evidencia una relación filogenética estrecha entre Sauropodomorpha+Theropoda.  ****************************************************  Referencias:  - Cabreira, S.F.; Kellner, A.W.A.; Dias-da-Silva, S.; da Silva, L.R.; Bronzati, M.; de Almeida Marsola, J.C.; Müller, R.T.; de Souza Bittencourt, J.; Batista, B.J.; Raugust, T.; Carrilho, R.; Brodt, A.; Langer, M.C.

These differences in conversion efficiency may be due to the genetic variability in ß-carotene metabolism of individual human subjects. Therefore, provitamin A carotenoids might not be a good vitamin A source for those subjects of the poor converter phenotype.   https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-11-genetic-link-vitamin-deficiency.html  However, Dr Lietz’ latest research - published in the FASEB Journal and presented this month at the 2nd Hohenheim Nutrition Conference in Stuttgart - shows that for many women, beta-carotene is not an effective substitute for vitamin A.   https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/beta-carotene-conversion-to-vitamin-a/  Almost half of Caucasians (and a slightly smaller percentage of other populations)  have polymorphisms in their BCMO1 gene that causes either a 30% or almost 70% decrease in the amount of vitamin A that they get from beta carotene foods and supplements.  http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/6/1545.full Conclusion: Variable absorption and conversion of ß-carotene to vitamin A both contribute to the variable response to consumption of ß-carotene. Our double-tracer approach is adaptable for identifying efficient converters of carotenoid to retinoid.  Both absorption and conversion to vitamin A contributed to the variable plasma response to ingested ß-carotene in our small group of subjects. Genetic factors may have also played a role (52) and the low-responder trait may be a stable characteristic (10, 11). Our results are relevant to ß-carotene supplementation programs to relieve vitamin A deficiency, to improve vitamin A nutritional status (2, 8, 15, 16), and to confer antioxidant protection (33). Our double-tracer protocol could be adapted to identify and screen for individuals and populations that can benefit from ß-carotene supplementation programs.  https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-saga/ https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-vagary/ http://empoweredsustenance.com/true-vitamin-a-foods/ http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/beta-carotene-vitamin-a-myth Why you can’t get vitamin A from eating vegetables  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091118072051.htm Almost half of UK women could be suffering from a lack of vitamin A due to a previously undiscovered genetic variation, scientists at Newcastle University have found.    but i digress  A is not converted from genes that many carry and those that can it should not be relied upon so no A in a vegan diet...   lets look at D sun exposure ! always sun when you have no clue of how it works you must have cholesterol levels to do this, with all vegans being hypocholesteronemia you do not produce vitamin D well, the only vegan source is mushrooms   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098082 CONCLUSION: Non-vegetarians had severe vitamin D deficiency, while vegetarians had vitamin D insufficiency irrespective of belonging to urban or rural area.  http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/08/10/making-sense-of-your-cholesterol-numbers.aspx Vitamin D and Your Cholesterol You probably are aware of the incredible influence of vitamin D on your health. If you aren't, or need a refresher, you can visit my vitamin D page. What most people do not realize is that the best way to obtain your vitamin D is from safe exposure to sun on your skin. The UVB rays in sunlight interact with the cholesterol on your skin and convert it to vitamin D. Bottom line? If your cholesterol level is too low you will not be able to use the sun to generate sufficient levels of vitamin D. Additionally, it provides some intuitive feedback that if cholesterol were so dangerous, why would your body use it as precursor for vitamin D and virtually all of the steroid hormones in your body? Other ""evidence"" that cholesterol is good for you?  http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Vitamin-D.html so you have been tested in blood tests for 25 hydroxy(inactive)  vs 1,25 dihydroxy(The active) form it     whoops!   cholesterol not needed! well lets look at that https://chriskresser.com/the-diet-heart-myth-cholesterol-and-saturated-fat-are-not-the-enemy/ On any given day, we have between 1,100 and 1,700 milligrams of cholesterol in our body. 25% of that comes from our diet, and 75% is produced inside of our bodies by the liver. http://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/cardiovascular/cholesterol/difference-between-ldl-and-hdl-cholesterol1.htm   Your body, mainly your liver, produces 75 percent of your cholesterol; your small intestine also aids in both the creation and absorption of cholesterol [source: AHA]   https://www.uncommonwisdomdaily.com/government-finally-admits-it-was-wrong-about-cholesterol-20213 That’s right! The liver produces 75% of our cholesterol and the other 25% comes from our diet.   http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/08/10/making-sense-of-your-cholesterol-numbers.aspx Your liver makes about 75 percent of your body's cholesterol,1 and according to conventional medicine, there are two types:   http://www.livestrong.com/article/28917-organ-produces-cholesterol/ The human body produces about 75 percent of the cholesterol in it at any given time.

Moreover, phytate was one of the strongest inhibitory predictors of calcium, iron and zinc bioavailability.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long CONCLUSION   The iron and zinc from vegetarian diets are generally less bioavailable than from nonvegetarian diets because of reduced meat intake as well as the tendency to consume more phytic acid and other plant-based inhibitors of iron and zinc absorption. However, in Western countries with varied and abundant food supplies, it is not clear that this reduced bioavailability has any functional consequences. Although vegetarians tend to have lower iron stores than omnivores, they appear to have no greater incidence of iron deficiency anemia. With current methods, it is not possible to effectively evaluate the influence of vegetarian diets on zinc nutrition because there are no reliable and sensitive criteria to identify marginal zinc nutriture in humans. The effectiveness of trace element supplementation of vegetarian diets has not been demonstrated, and any recommendations for supplementation should consider potential adverse effects, including possible competitive interactions between minerals. Research to further define the functional consequences of low iron stores without anemia and to sensitively detect marginal zinc status is needed to detect and prevent any possible problems associated with lower iron and zinc absorption from vegetarian diets.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17299475 CONCLUSIONS: In this population, fracture risk was similar for meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians. The higher fracture risk in the vegans appeared to be a consequence of their considerably lower mean calcium intake. An adequate calcium intake is essential for bone health, irrespective of dietary preferences.  but i digress, more veganism debunked",0,2017-07-09T17:24:28.000Z,0.126213667285,0.491628014842,en,others,http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/5/1468S.full,False,False

Here, a new perspective on climate change causality is presented using the central England temperature (CET) dataset, the longest instrumental temperature record, and a combination of slow feature analysis and wavelet analysis. The driving forces of climate change were investigated and the results showed two independent degrees of freedom —a 3.36-year cycle and a 22.6-year cycle, which seem to be connected to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation cycle and the Hale sunspot cycle, respectively. Moreover, these driving forces were modulated in amplitude by signals with millennial timescales.

We study the long-term variability of a sample of five solar analog stars using composite chromospheric activity records up to 50 years in length and synoptic visible-band photometry about 20 years long. This sample covers a large range of stellar ages which we use to represent the evolution in activity for solar mass stars. We find that young, fast rotators have an amplitude of variability many times that of the solar cycle, while old, slow rotators have very little variability. We discuss the possible impacts of this variability on young Earth and exoplanet climates.

The purpose of this study is to explore the response of extreme precipitation to solar activity and El Nino events in typical regions of the Loess Plateau—a case study in the Yan’an area. The precipitation data was from nine weather stations in Yan’an and the sunspot number and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were from 1951 to 2015. The results show that maximum precipitation occurred mainly at the peak sunspot number or 2a near it and the sunspot number minimum and valley values were not significantly correlated. The results of Morlet wavelet showed that a 41-year period of precipitation was the most obvious within the 64-year scale. Similarly, sunspot number showed a 16-year periodic variability. Correlation analyses of the 16-year and 41-year scales demonstrated that the relationships between precipitation and sunspot number were close. In addition, extreme precipitation often occurred in the year following El Nino events. According to 10-year moving average curves, precipitation generally showed a downward trend when SOI was negative. The results indicate that solar activity and El Nino events had significant impacts on precipitation in typical regions of the Loess Plateau.

Yes, I understand that getting a complete protein is more beneficial, since it includes BCAAs, but buying a small jug of whey goes a very short way... You end up spending more in the long run... Quite contradictory to my ""budget"" point. The main issue I'm raising is if someone is on a - budget. Would BCAA's be helpful if they could not afford whey all the time? Surly. So that's why I would not put it on an exclude list. Overall, I think we can agree to agree :D Yes, I think we're in agreement in more ways than not. Really... While weight lifting on a budget, eating whole eggs is the best way to go :) You get everything you need. BCAAs, protein, various vitamins and minerals. Just add some carbs and you're good to go.Some people take issue with egg cholesterol... As you know, cholesterol can be good or bad. In fact it's extremely helpful in the production of testosterone.

As for the US gov saying meat eaters aren't getting enough B12, they didn't say mixed or meat diets don't provide B12, they said people are not getting enough out of it. This comes down to poor diet by the individual, it has nothing to do with eating meat in itself. What a baseless argument, surely you are clutching at straws here.

However, I am 64 and I still have to motivate myself to exercise very day.  I have not yet learned to make it a completely  automatic part of my day although it was a lot easier when I was able to cycle or walk to work for some of my jobs. That said, ""radical"" vegans appear to agree with you: http://nutritionstudies.org/reasons-you-should-include-exercise-in-your-diet-plan/  There's  also some evidence that exercise and not smoking are more important than diet http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/4/963.full  I am agnostic about the fish thing though. The 7th Day Adventists mortality study certainly suggests that pescovegetarians have lower mortality than vegans who in turn have lower mortality than lacto-ovo vegetarians, semi vegetarians and regular meat eaters. Perhaps this is because of the omega 3 in fish.  I understand that many vegans have poor omega 3:6 ratios. http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1710093  On the other hand, a number of studies have suggested that fish offers no protective benefit or at least that the evidence is inconclusive eg http://canceranddiet.nl/survival-mortality/fish.html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725883 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4356893/  Most vegan advocates argue that vegans need to supplement to avoid B12 and vitamin D deficiencies and to eat foods that address the omega 3:6 issue.  For example, this 2003 presentation by Greger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7KeRwdIH04  I am not a vegan myself but I only have a little dairy every week and eat a small amount of meat or fish perhaps  half a dozen times a year.  However, I don't understand how vegans (who by definition don't eat fish anyway) saying we shouldn't eat fish thereby become ""radical vegans"".... they are no more radical than any other vegan are they?",0,2015-03-28T00:55:26.000Z,0.080505952381,0.48950091575099997,en,others,http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/4/963.full,False,False

This high percentage of individuals having long term immunity has been compromised by mass vaccination of children which provides at best 70 to 90% immunity that is temporary and of unknown duration—shifting chickenpox to a more vulnerable adult population where chickenpox carries 20 times more risk of death and 15 times more risk of hospitalization compared to children. Add to this the adverse effects of both the chickenpox and shingles vaccines as well as the potential for increased risk of shingles for an estimated 30 to 50 years among adults.

When David Stetzer visited Russia and was shown the research they had on health damage caused by low frequency RFR he noted that above 1.7 KHz the Dirty electricity (DE) radiates off the power line (or wire) and has enough energy to couple internal to the human body. Sam Milham, MD, MPH has a published paper on the cancer cluster at La Quita middle school near Palm Springs CA.  Here is some additional video and commentary from Paul Harding who is pursuing EMRS & BBEC certification:  ""What was unknown until now is that additional frequencies are transmitted in the 2 to 50 kilohertz range. Numerous studies have shown repeatedly that those very same frequencies disrupt the human nervous system. Indeed, ""nerve block"" is the phrase used in the studies to describe what occurs.  The studies are not controversial. In other words, there are no studies that show otherwise. Nerve block induced by frequencies in the 2 to 50 kilohertz range is an established fact. The studies that show this nerve block are all from mainstream sources including the epitome of ""establishment"" science when it comes to electricity, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

He deleted the comments, which is perfectly fine. Except, I took the time to respond and that was NOT shown since the original comment was deleted. So here's my response: Circadian rhythm does not change regardless of meal frequency. Free-fatty acids will be elevated in the evening regardless of fasting all day. This has to do with the circadian rhymicity of the body preparing for low-level activity and sleep in the evening. Now it seems that the prevalent practice of omad is having that meal in the evening which is a clever strategy since hunger tends to be higher in the evening and thus it's easier to fast in the morning and even at lunch because hunger is not as high. And this front load fasting exacerbates hunger in the evening in addition to the inherent problems of eating one meal a day regarding nutritional adequacy and the pressure to have adequate variety in one meal. How many meals one consumes whether that be 1, 2 or 3 does not change chronobiology. The body is simply going to be more insulin resistant at night and glucose intolerant, meaning how many meals one eats in a day 1-3 will not change this infallible fact. Regarding the rest of your commentary you are just all over the place and it seems like you have way more questions than answers. I'm not against intermittent fasting in fact I'm quite the hybridized health advocate in that I don't necessarily see things All or Nothing. I like to explore incorporate various methods but you seem to be all in on omad, which is indicative of the type of cult-like extremism mindset of omad. And since we are least physically active in the evening, logically it would make sense to eat during the day to fuel the days actvities which sets up better appetite regulation in the evening as well as a better physiological response to a dinner, in addition to increasing opportunity for nutritional adequacy and variety from eating at least two to three meals a day as opposed to just one. AND it's obvious you did not look at the studies in the video description. There have been a handful of studies done on omad compared to three meals a day and all of them found negative effects from one meal a day. Those studies are in my video description. Tgere has not been one single study showing one meal to be healthy or beneficial. And let me give you a thought provoking thought. Regarding, the well-known benefits of autophagy induced from fasting or caloric restriction, there's actually some research has shown autophagy can be a double-edged sword. Meaning it's favorable mostly, but it may also have some unfavorable caveats, thus adding caution to the overexpression of catabolic signaling from extended fasting via omad. Omad is nothing more than an extreme obsession and over emphasis on caloric restriction and fasting. But I'm not going to convince you. I just simply state the facts as they are. My approach is simple: I eat 3-4 nutrient-dense dense meals per day spaced out by at least 3 or more hours and I don't eat past 9 pm. I also exercise daily. I also incorporate fasted exercise, I do intermittent fasting occasionally as well. And sometimes I eat only two meals a day. I have a lot more diversity and variety than you're simplistic all-in omad diet. I just find it very troubling to hear comments like yours and that you actually believe in this omad ludicrousy. It's just mind blowing. And the body receives adequate fasting benefits from sleep, by doing intermittent fasting of at least 12+ hours. Omad does not need to be done to attain some miraculous additional benefits. It's just absolutely absurd, preposterous and ridiculous that you're actually supporting this crazy hoax of a diet.  And here's a ""glimpse"" study on the dysregulation omad/irregular eating can induce- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220945 Lastly, it's called the ""Second meal effect"" for a reason. There's a beneficial pulsating element and pancreatic priming element of eating 2-4 meals per day vs. 1. And regarding the blue zones data, not one of those populations does omad.",1,2017-07-29T18:27:31.000Z,0.0784380952381,0.464347619048,en,pmid,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220945,False,False

Your adrenal glands are located on the top part of your kidneys and they are endocrine glands. These glands are responsible for the release of several hormones, such as steroids and adrenaline.  The importance of these hormones cannot be overemphasized, as they help to regulate your blood pressure, boost your immunity, and your rate of metabolism. Your body is better equipped to handle stress with these hormones released in your body, so any obstruction to the function of the adrenal glands can lead to a myriad of health problems.....

In fact, this herb has a millennia old tradition in culinary and natural medicine practices all over the world.  In the period between the Elizabethan Era and the Early Romantic period, rosemary was regarded as the herb of remembrance. Also, it has long been used as a symbol for remembrance during weddings, war commemorations and funerals in Europe and Australia.    Because of its unique scent this herb is often made into a sort of herbal-amulet, then placed under pillows, or used in bouquets. In the past it was believed that using rosemary in these ways not only protected against bad dreams, but also increased memory.  Rosemary’s effects on memory have even been scientifically proved. A 2003 study conducted by Moss, Cook, Wesnes, and Duckett, found that the inhalation of rosemary essential oil, considerably improved primary and secondary memory in study participants.    A 2012 study examining the effects of rosemary on memory function included 28 elderly people (average 75 years old). The study confirmed that dried rosemary leaf powder improved cognitive performance in the participants.  A different study by Mark Moss and Lorraine Oliver at Northumbria University, Newcastle revealed that 1,8-cineole, a compound found in rosemary, is the substance that triggers cognitive and mood improvements. Further studies by the same group of researchers, found that diffusion of rosemary essential oil could lead to memory enhancements of up to 75%...........

""  One reference is at 1:45 but it's not analysed in depth. To do that you need to go beyond a 6 minute video and read the studies themselves. Here is some information about four studies into the consensus. Google them and read them  1. “The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change” (Oreskes 2004). She reviewed 928 papers selected via the key term “climate change”. No papers disagreed with the consensus view on AGW. http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686.full  2.  “Examining the scientific consensus on climate change” (Doran & Zimmerman 2009). They put the question ‘Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?’ Of the publishing climate scientists surveyed 97.4% answered ‘yes’. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009EO030002/epdf  3.  “Expert credibility in climate change” (Anderegg et al 2010). They classified 1372 climate researchers based on signed statements either supporting or dissenting from the primary tenets of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report. Of the 908 most actively publishing climatologists, 97% agreed with the tenets of anthropogenic climate change. As individuals these researchers also produced more papers and attracted more citations than did the dissenters. www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107.full.pdf  4. “Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature” (2013). This study looked at 11,944 abstracts mentioning global climate change or global warming. Of the papers taking a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed it, 1.9% rejected it and 1.0% were uncertain. Scientists were also asked to self-rate their papers.  97.2% of self-rated papers endorsed AGW while 2.8% rejected it. Of the respondents (rather than their papers) expressing an opinion on AGW, 96.4% endorsed it while 3.6% rejected it.  That last paper with its methods & results can be accessed here: iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf/1748-9326_8_2_024024.pdf  The titles of the 11,944 papers together followed by their endorsement - rejection ratings given in the study are listed here: http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/media/erl460291datafile.txt  How's that for transparency? So all you have to do to disprove the 97% consensus is go through those abstracts, rate them yourself then compare your ratings of the abstracts with those given by the Cook et al people. If you can find thousands - or even hundreds - of climate change contrarians in there that have been falsely represented by Cook et al you can change that 97% figure and become an instant hero of contrarians the world over. All you need is 40 wrongly rated papers to bring it down to 96%! So please, take the time and do the legwork.

Τσεκαρε εδω http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8539 Λοιπον, η μαλακια με τις ερευνες που δημοσιευονται ειναι οτι δημοσιευεται ο,τι να 'ναι. Σπουδαζω Ιατρικη κι εχω κανει εργασιες και ξερω. Οπως ο FDA κανει ο,τι γουσταρει, ετσι και τα περιοδικα, που btw πληρωνονται για να δημοσιευσουν κατι, κανουν ο,τι γουσταρουν. Οι ερευνες που αξιζει να δινουμε σημασια ειναι οι μετα-αναλυσεις, ως πιο αντικειμενεικες μετα απο στατιστικη αναλυση πολλων ερευνων, οποτε και τα αποτελεσματα ανατρεπονται. Οταν κανεις μια ερευνα, δν ειναι ευκολο να απομονωνεις παραγοντες. Εξηγω: αν καποιος τρωει 3 αυγα τη μερα κ καθολου κρεας, γυμναζεται, δν καπνιζει, δν ειναι αγχωδεις, ζει ευτυχισμενα, προφανως, θ εχει καλυτερη υγεια απο καποιον π τρωει 1 αυγο μερα παρα μερα και κανει ο,τι ανθυγιεινο μπορεις να φανταστεις. Οι καθηγητες μας, που λες, μας διδαξαν οτι βαρος θ δινουμε μονο στα ψηλα επιπεδα καλης χοληστερινης (η HDL κ οχι η LDL, που λες εσυ), στα χαμηλα επιπεδα τριγλυκεριδιων κ κακης χοληστερινης. Δλδ εγω που εχω 211 ολικη χοληστερινη, αλλα οι αλλοι παραγοντες ειναι καλη, κινδυνευω λιγοτερο απο καποιον που εχει 180 ολικη, αλλα τα αλλα ειναι για τον πουτσο. Παντα, μα ΠΑΝΤΑ, υπαρχουν και αλλοι παραγοντες που επηρεαζουν τις πιθανοτητες να πεθανεις απο ψηλη χοληστερινη στο αιμα, πετιβαλλοντικοι και γενετικοι. Οποτε, δν μπορεις να απογυμνωσεις μονο τον παραγοντα χοληστετινη. Η συμβουλη για να μην καταναλωνουμε καθολου χοληστερινη ειναι για τον πουτσο. Ψαξε γ τη φυσιολογια της χοληστερινης και θα καταλαβεις τι εννοω. Επιγραμματικα: η χοληστετινη ειναι ΑΠΑΡΑΙΤΗΤΟ συστατικο των μεμβρανων ΟΛΩΝ των κυτταρων μας, χρησιμοποιειται απο το Κεντρικο Νευρικο Συστημα και παραγεται απο τον οργανισμο μας (χολη-στερινη, οπως λεμε εστερας χολικων αλατων, αν θυμαμαι καλα). Ο καρκινος, οπως ολα μας τα κυτταρα, χρειαζονται ολα τα μικτοθρεοτικα συστατικα. Σακχαρα, αμινοξεα, λιπαρα οξεα ειναι απαραιτητα για να επιβιωσει. Αν του στερισεις τη μεθειονινη θα πεθανει, οπως ολα μας τα κυτταρα. Αν του πτοσφερεις απειρη μεθειονινη, αλλα δν εχει ολα τα αλλα, παλι θα πεθανει. Ειναι, κ παλι, απειρη οι παραγοντες που παιζουν ρολο, αλλιως θ ειχαν βρει τη θεραπεια του. Εν κατακλειδι, οπως ολες οι τροφες, ετσι και το αυγο, πρεπει να καταναλωνεται με μετρο. Τελευταιες ερευνες δειχνουν οτι επικινδυνα λιπαρα δν ειναι ειναι ολα τα κορεσμενα, αλλα αυτα που ειναι υδρογονωμενα και απο επεξεργασμενα τροφιμα. Επισης, το αυγο διαθετει κτ ακομα, που μου διαφρυγει τωρα, ισως ινουλινη, που ρυθμιζει τη χοληστερινη στο αιμα. ΕΦΟΣΟΝ, ειναι καποιος ηδη υγιης και ακολουθει γενικα καλες υγιεινοδιαιτητικες συνηθειες, μπορει να τρωει αφοβα καθε μερα 1-2 αυγα. Φυσικα, προτιμονται τα ελευθερας βοσκης, γιατι τα αυγα κλωβοστοιχιας, εχει βρεθει οτι ειναι χειροτερα απο αποψη θρεπτικων συστατικων. Υ.γ. Ευτυχως για μας, η σαλμονελα πεθαινει στις ψηλες θερμοκρασιες. Κατα τη δικη σου λογικη, ουτε κοτοπουλο θ επρεπε να τρωμε, γιατι λογω αυτου εχουν πεθανει πολλοι πετισσοτεροι απο σαλμονελωσεις. Αυτο εχει να κανει αποκλειστικα με τις συνθηκες κατω απ τις οποιες μαγειρευονται τα τροφιμα. Π.χ. σφιχτο αυγο αποκλειεται να εχει σαλμονελα γιατι βραζει αρκετα λεπτα, ωστε να πεθανει το μικροβιο, αλλα ενα καλα ψημενο κοτοπουλο μπορει να σου προκαλεσει σαλμονελωση, αν ο μαγειρας το πιασει με χερια που ακουμπησαν σε μολυσμενο ωμο κοτοπουλο και δεν τα εχει πλυνει.  Υγ2-φιλικη συμβουλη: συμβουλευσου καποιον ειδικο πριν δημοσιευσεις καποιο βιντεο ή κανε εκτεταμενες ερευνες.

These differences in conversion efficiency may be due to the genetic variability in ß-carotene metabolism of individual human subjects. Therefore, provitamin A carotenoids might not be a good vitamin A source for those subjects of the poor converter phenotype.   https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-11-genetic-link-vitamin-deficiency.html  However, Dr Lietz’ latest research - published in the FASEB Journal and presented this month at the 2nd Hohenheim Nutrition Conference in Stuttgart - shows that for many women, beta-carotene is not an effective substitute for vitamin A.   https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/beta-carotene-conversion-to-vitamin-a/  Almost half of Caucasians (and a slightly smaller percentage of other populations)  have polymorphisms in their BCMO1 gene that causes either a 30% or almost 70% decrease in the amount of vitamin A that they get from beta carotene foods and supplements.  http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/6/1545.full Conclusion: Variable absorption and conversion of ß-carotene to vitamin A both contribute to the variable response to consumption of ß-carotene. Our double-tracer approach is adaptable for identifying efficient converters of carotenoid to retinoid.  Both absorption and conversion to vitamin A contributed to the variable plasma response to ingested ß-carotene in our small group of subjects. Genetic factors may have also played a role (52) and the low-responder trait may be a stable characteristic (10, 11). Our results are relevant to ß-carotene supplementation programs to relieve vitamin A deficiency, to improve vitamin A nutritional status (2, 8, 15, 16), and to confer antioxidant protection (33). Our double-tracer protocol could be adapted to identify and screen for individuals and populations that can benefit from ß-carotene supplementation programs.  https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-saga/ https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-vagary/ http://empoweredsustenance.com/true-vitamin-a-foods/ http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/beta-carotene-vitamin-a-myth Why you can’t get vitamin A from eating vegetables  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091118072051.htm Almost half of UK women could be suffering from a lack of vitamin A due to a previously undiscovered genetic variation, scientists at Newcastle University have found.    but i digress  A is not converted from genes that many carry and those that can it should not be relied upon so no A in a vegan diet...   lets look at D sun exposure ! always sun when you have no clue of how it works you must have cholesterol levels to do this, with all vegans being hypocholesteronemia you do not produce vitamin D well, the only vegan source is mushrooms   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098082 CONCLUSION: Non-vegetarians had severe vitamin D deficiency, while vegetarians had vitamin D insufficiency irrespective of belonging to urban or rural area.  http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/08/10/making-sense-of-your-cholesterol-numbers.aspx Vitamin D and Your Cholesterol You probably are aware of the incredible influence of vitamin D on your health. If you aren't, or need a refresher, you can visit my vitamin D page. What most people do not realize is that the best way to obtain your vitamin D is from safe exposure to sun on your skin. The UVB rays in sunlight interact with the cholesterol on your skin and convert it to vitamin D. Bottom line? If your cholesterol level is too low you will not be able to use the sun to generate sufficient levels of vitamin D. Additionally, it provides some intuitive feedback that if cholesterol were so dangerous, why would your body use it as precursor for vitamin D and virtually all of the steroid hormones in your body?

Moreover, phytate was one of the strongest inhibitory predictors of calcium, iron and zinc bioavailability.   http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long CONCLUSION   The iron and zinc from vegetarian diets are generally less bioavailable than from nonvegetarian diets because of reduced meat intake as well as the tendency to consume more phytic acid and other plant-based inhibitors of iron and zinc absorption. However, in Western countries with varied and abundant food supplies, it is not clear that this reduced bioavailability has any functional consequences. Although vegetarians tend to have lower iron stores than omnivores, they appear to have no greater incidence of iron deficiency anemia. With current methods, it is not possible to effectively evaluate the influence of vegetarian diets on zinc nutrition because there are no reliable and sensitive criteria to identify marginal zinc nutriture in humans. The effectiveness of trace element supplementation of vegetarian diets has not been demonstrated, and any recommendations for supplementation should consider potential adverse effects, including possible competitive interactions between minerals. Research to further define the functional consequences of low iron stores without anemia and to sensitively detect marginal zinc status is needed to detect and prevent any possible problems associated with lower iron and zinc absorption from vegetarian diets.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17299475 CONCLUSIONS: In this population, fracture risk was similar for meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians. The higher fracture risk in the vegans appeared to be a consequence of their considerably lower mean calcium intake. An adequate calcium intake is essential for bone health, irrespective of dietary preferences.  but i digress, more veganism debunked",0,2017-07-09T17:24:28.000Z,0.126213667285,0.491628014842,en,others,http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/5/1468S.full,False,False

Instead, you chose to attack the figure comparing fat loss in the BCAA group and carbohydrate group stating that the authors were incorrect for giving significance to the BCAA group over the CHO group who lost about 0.6% more fat comparatively. The authors didn’t choose to assign statistical significance to this figure.. statistical analysis are run through extensive algorithms in programs like SPSS.

Regardless, my argument was never that BCAAs should be utilized for fat loss. I stated that BCAA consumption while in a catabolic state, i.e. glycogen depletion during prolonged resistance training, the activation of mTOR prevents muscle degradation after the depletion of muscle glycogen. Your metabolism has no direct communication with your surroundings, it doesn’t know that you’re not running from a lion who is about to eat you. It has no idea that it doesn’t need to break down muscle for energy because you’re in no real danger. By consuming these essential amino acids, it communicates to your metabolism that you’re not in danger/fight or flight and that you have a plentiful source of building blocks to initiate MPS instead of breaking down muscle for gluconeogenesis.  Now, I mistakenly linked the same paper twice in my previous response, but these two additional studies provide support to benefit of BCAA supplementation intra-workout by substantially reducing fatigue and increasing workout performance. In the first by increasing time to exhaustion by an average of 17.2% greater across all subjects administered BCAA supplementation compared to the control in glycogen-depleted subjects. http://www.innobio.cn/uploads/soft/160525/1-1605251A153.pdf Additionally, Kim et al. found the same performance benefits in a study from 2013. It was found that consumption of BCAAs lead to preservation of lean mass by diminishing the presence of muscle-damaging substances like lactate dehydrogenase which contributes to lactic acid build up in muscle, and also creatine kinase which has been demonstrated to play roles in striated muscle tissue disintegration (especially in muscular dystrophy and rhabdomyolysis) while the placebo group showed higher levels of both at all test times compared to the BCAA group. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241904/ There is more research providing insights into the benefits of BCAA supplementation than there are studies who corroborate your opinion that BCAAs show no effect. You chose to pick at the previously mentioned article for points that aren't even relevant to the actual benefits of taking BCAAs to support this video. Nobody takes them as a fat burner. They're used to preserve lean muscle mass during glycogen-depleted training; this was supported by the paper, yet you completely disregarded that to support your opinion in this video. Saying the price tag isn't worth their benefits is an absolutely reasonable opinion, but by denying that they have any benefits at all when the research shows the contrary you're doing a disservice to your viewer base.",0,2017-10-28T02:06:53.000Z,0.0793724279835,0.4269547325100001,en,pmc,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241904/,False,False

This high percentage of individuals having long term immunity has been compromised by mass vaccination of children which provides at best 70 to 90% immunity that is temporary and of unknown duration—shifting chickenpox to a more vulnerable adult population where chickenpox carries 20 times more risk of death and 15 times more risk of hospitalization compared to children. Add to this the adverse effects of both the chickenpox and shingles vaccines as well as the potential for increased risk of shingles for an estimated 30 to 50 years among adults.

Now, I mistakenly linked the same paper twice in my previous response, but these two additional studies provide support to benefit of BCAA supplementation intra-workout by substantially reducing fatigue and increasing workout performance. In the first by increasing time to exhaustion by an average of 17.2% greater across all subjects administered BCAA supplementation compared to the control in glycogen-depleted subjects. http://www.innobio.cn/uploads/soft/160525/1-1605251A153.pdf Additionally, Kim et al. found the same performance benefits in a study from 2013. It was found that consumption of BCAAs lead to preservation of lean mass by diminishing the presence of muscle-damaging substances like lactate dehydrogenase which contributes to lactic acid build up in muscle, and also creatine kinase which has been demonstrated to play roles in striated muscle tissue disintegration (especially in muscular dystrophy and rhabdomyolysis) while the placebo group showed higher levels of both at all test times compared to the BCAA group. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241904/ There is more research providing insights into the benefits of BCAA supplementation than there are studies who corroborate your opinion that BCAAs show no effect. You chose to pick at the previously mentioned article for points that aren't even relevant to the actual benefits of taking BCAAs to support this video. Nobody takes them as a fat burner. They're used to preserve lean muscle mass during glycogen-depleted training; this was supported by the paper, yet you completely disregarded that to support your opinion in this video. Saying the price tag isn't worth their benefits is an absolutely reasonable opinion, but by denying that they have any benefits at all when the research shows the contrary you're doing a disservice to your viewer base.",0,2017-10-28T02:06:53.000Z,0.0793724279835,0.4269547325100001,en,pmc,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241904/,False,False

He also states that Talk Origins misrepresents the “facts”. Throughout this video he constantly refers to the facts however he never makes it quite clear what facts he is talking about. From 1:00 to 2:06, AbusiveAntiTheist (AAT) explains what ERVs are and explains that the animals we are closely related to share more of the same ERVs than animals we are not closely related to. OFNF then concedes that AAT’s explanation would be reasonable if evolution were true. Obviously, OFNF does not consider evolution true. Keep in mind that the explanation AAT gave in this video is an explanation showing that organisms that are closely related will have more similarities than organisms that are less related. Also, keep in mind how vague the notion that “many similarities between organisms indicate that they are closely related while fewer similarities between animals indicate that they are less closely related” is. Though this notion is a very, very, very rudimentary notion used in regards to evolution, it is not specific as the more complicated reasoning behind the theory of evolution. OFNF attacks this extremely vague notion and uses his criticism of the notion to attack the whole theory of evolution. This is a clear example of straw-manning a position if there ever was one. This will be made clear later on. At 3:30 he makes a distinction between the facts and the interpretation of the facts. He concedes that there are many similarities between organisms at 3:36. However, he does not concede that the fact that animals have similarities implies that animals who share many similarities are closely related. In fact, he states that such an assumption is merely an interpretation of the fact that organisms possess many similarities. He seems to believe that the phylogenetic tree is based solely on the vague assumption that the more similarities that animals have then the more they are related while the less similarities animals have between each other indicates that they are less related. However, he never elaborates on what he means by “similarities” and he never elaborates on what specific animals he is talking about until later on. Well, he sort of elaborates later on. He also claims that “evolutionists” only teach one side of the story as if there is some sort of valid alternative to evolution in the discipline of biology. He also claims that “evolutionists” go through great lengths to ban the controversy regarding evolution from being taught in the class room. He also states that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence while keeping contrary evidence out of the class room. He again states that the “facts” state otherwise. At this point this is where we sort of get into the details. OFNF goes on to cite an article titled “Rewriting Evolution: Tiny molecules called microRNAs are tearing apart traditional ideas about the animal family tree.” as an example of “evolutionists” ignoring contrary evidence. Humorously, he highlights the part of the title that states that microRNA is changing the order of the family tree of evolution yet ignores that the title implies that evolution will still be true being that the title says that evolution is being rewritten and not being shown to be false. He then quotes a part of the article which includes molecular paleobiologist at Dartmouth College, Kevin Peterson’s own words.   “’I’ve looked at thousands of microRNA genes, and I can’t find a single example that would support the traditional tree,” he says. The technique “just changes everything about our understanding of mammal evolution’.”   Here we see another sign of the inconsistency of OFNF’s reasoning. Earlier in the video he stated that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence to evolution yet OFNF cites Peterson (someone he considers an evolutionist) that deals directly with evidence that OFNF considers contrary to evolution. The rest of the article cites other evolutionists who are not ignoring what OFNF considers contrary evidence. This is a tad bit hilarious. He claims that evolutionists are ignoring contrary evidence yet cites a whole article of “evolutionists” not ignoring the very data that OFNF feels is contrary to evolution.  Even funnier is that nothing in the article is contrary to evolution. The article states that Peterson’s findings are contrary to the traditional evolutionary branches on the evolutionary tree yet Peterson’s evidence still supports an evolutionary tree. For example, the article OFNF cites shows a picture of a side-by-side comparison of the traditional evolutionary tree of placental mammals and Kevin Peterson’s evolutionary tree of placental mammals on the PDF of the article. What OFNF fails to communicate is that the two different branches in the side-by-side comparison still show that placental mammals are still a closely related family on their own branch no matter which branch is correct on this side-by-side comparison. Essentially, it is the order and placement of twigs on the branch that is in question. It is not evolution that is in question. Peterson’s evidence is still in support of evolution. OFNF’s claim that there is controversy within the biological community is overstated. If anything the article is great news because it shows that we are improving our understanding of biological evolution. If Peterson is right then we will only make the theory of evolution a stronger theory. If Peterson is wrong then it still makes the theory of evolution a stronger theory. It is a win-win situation being that Peterson’s evidence supports evolution anyways. However, Peterson’s data has not yet been confirmed as the article states.   At 5:06 OFNF continues on to state that in order to get published in peer-reviewed scientific journals one’s results have to line up with the theory of evolution regardless if your data is irrefutable. According to OFNF, if your data doesn’t line up with evolution then your work doesn’t get published and people will have a bias against you. OFNF then supports his assertion by quote mining the article at 5:21. Quote:   “At first, Peterson and Sempere had a tough time publishing their results suggesting that animals had accumulated regulatory microRNAs. ‘One of the reviewers said it was impossible, what we were describing,’ says Peterson.”   OFNF seems to gloss over the two sentences right after the quote he cites that states that Peterson’s papers were eventually published.   “In the end, the work was published in a specialized zoology journal. Subsequent papers, however, won over some sceptics and Peterson was soon publishing in Nature and Science”   Keep in mind that Nature and Science are very prestigious and mainstream science journals that did not ignore Peterson’s findings.   Furthermore, Peterson’s papers were not initially rejected because his data did not align with the theory of evolution. His data was rejected because it was brand new data that has never been seen at the time, period. This is how science works. New data must survive tons of scrutiny before getting published so as to maintain a high standard within the discipline. Sometimes new data gets rejected a few times when going through the peer-review process before finally gaining acceptance. The peer-review process is exactly how Newton and Einstein’s findings gained acceptance. Their findings were scrutinized and sometimes rejected but soon gained acceptance. Peterson’s findings gained acceptance the same way. OFNF then states that creationists have their own scientific journals because of this alleged bias. However, it is clear that OFNF is wrong. He then quotes the same article but only quotes those that disagree with Peterson’s findings. OFNF does not show you the quotes that show that not everyone in the same field as Peterson disagrees with Peterson. After all, Peterson would not have been able to get published if no one agreed with him. Nonetheless, here’s a quote from the same article OFNF quote mines that shows that others agree with Peterson’s microRNA findings:    “That has won him many critics, but also some strong supporters. ‘Peterson and his col­leagues have demonstrated that microRNAs are a powerful tool in determining the rela­tionships of major animal groups,’ says Derek Briggs, director of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, Connecticut.”       Elsewhere in the article, evolutionary bioinformatician, Peter Stadler agrees:   “‘It is a really clever and fresh approach to phylogeny,’ says Peter Stadler, an evolutionary bioinformatician at the University of Leipzig in Germany. ‘I don’t quite know why pres­ence/absence of microRNAs is not used more frequently in deep phylogeny approaches.’”   It is clear that scientists are divided on this matter and it is clear that the matter is a work in progress as the article indicates.   OFNF then quotes an abstract of a paper entitled the “Gene tree discordance, phylogenetic inference and the multispecies coalescent”. This is a sophomore move from OFNF. A simple Wikipedia search will show that abstracts are very limited and that the full article should be consulted. Consulting an abstract alone is inadequate when trying to get the full picture. Based on what OFNF quoted from the abstract, Wikipedia is actually right. What OFNF forgiven quoted from the abstract is not very specific at all. At 6:48 OFNF quotes from the abstract stating:   “…conflicting genealogical histories often exist in different genes throughout the genome…resolving close species relationships is not quite as simple as applying more data to the problem.”   From these two statements and a small quote from the article OFNF claims that the article shows genetic trees are different depending on what set of genetic data one looks at but he does not elaborate to what extent the trees are changed. Is the entire evolutionary tree different such that bees fall on a twig on the evolutionary branch of placental mammals or are the differences in genetic trees minor such that tiny twigs of closely related species fall on different places of slightly bigger twig but still strongly support the theory of evolution? OFNF never elaborates on this. However, the abstract OFNF quotes states that resolving [close] species relationships is not simple which indicates that the major branches on the evolutionary tree are well confirmed but it is the minute details of the twigs on this tree which needs further investigation and refining. In other words, the evolutionary tree has been demonstrated. At 8:10, OFNF cites the paper titled “Mapping Human Genetic Ancestry” (http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/10/2266.full.pdf+html), and uses the paper to argue against evolution. The paper does state that human evolution is not entirely certain but the paper does state that human evolution did occur. It is also certain that the great apes are closely related and share a common ancestor as is shown in table 2 and 3 of the paper. The paper also doesn’t ignore the incongruent data. The paper actually addresses the data directly and admits to the incongruent data though OFNF ignores that while once again falsely claiming that contrary data is ignored. It seems like it is OFNF that is ignoring the data. OFNF also states that phylogenetic trees cannot be used to prove the family tree but he fails to realize that they are one in the same. He also fails to realize that the family tree cannot be proven because new data can always turn up which could change current phylogeny (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/phylogenetics_05). In fact, no science is ever proven exactly because new data can always change current scientific knowledge. All scientific theories are tentative so it is nonsensical for OFNF to ask for the family tree to be proven. The evolutionary tree has already been demonstrated anyways. At 9:38 OFNF quotes the article with Kevin Peterson once again and asserts that AAT is only paying attention to what conforms to AAT’s supposedly preconceived notion that the theory of evolution is correct a priori. However, I have already shown how OFNF has grossly misrepresented the article which renders his charge against ATT superfluous. OFNF then moves on to talk about ERVs but OFNF doesn’t just talk about ERVs, he grossly misrepresents what ERVs tell us about evolution. OFNF argues that it is very likely that chimps and humans would share identical ERV sites while still acquiring ERV cites independently because there are so many cites (~30,000) in human DNA and ERV cites do not occur in random spots. Even granting OFNFs constraints, his argument still does not explain why only specific species share the same exact ERV cites that others do not. For instance, the HERV-K insertion is only shared among various primates. Also, small cats (e.g. the jungle cat, European wildcat, African wildcat, blackfooted cat, and domestic cat) under the family Felidae all share a specific retrogene insertion not found in any other carnivore. Is OFNF going to argue that the matching EVR insertions that are exclusive to primates occurred independently for each primate species but match up perfectly by coincidence? How about the ERV insertion that small cats in the Felidae family share? Did that insertion occur independently of every species in that group but just happens to match up perfectly while that same insertion is completely absent from all other animals? I think not. Clearly, he is just trying to discredit evolution even if his objections make no sense. Given that ERVs are only passed down to descendants it is clear that animals that share ERVs are related and small groups of different species that exclusively share ERVs all share common ancestry. Basically, ERVs do support evolution despite OFNF’s objections in this video.

Soteris Kalogriou once said “The origin and continuation of humankind is based on solar energy.” We should depend on the sun for energy because if it ever runs out I think we have bigger problems. According to Nicola Armorali and Vincenzo Balzani “To overcome the negative impacts on the environment and other problems associated with fossil fuels, have forced many countries to inquire into and change to environmental friendly alternatives that are renewable to sustain the increasing energy demand. Solar energy is one of the best renewable energy sources with least negative impacts on the environment.”   B. How can we stop depending on non-renewable resources and start relying on renewables? Simple, we depend on the sun. The sun is always renewable and isn’t looking or feeling like it’s going to go out anytime soon and if it does I don’t think we will have much to worry about anyways. The earth is and always will be running out of resources. The more we use the less we have, we continue to depend on coal, natural gas, and oil and the inevitable fact is that we will run out. In a book by A. A. M. Sayigh he wrote “In a world of dwindling conventional energy resources, a rising population, and rapid technological advancements, it is inevitable in the near future that the present energy system will change drastically, and as I see it solar energy will play a prominent role.” There needs to be a much higher demand and interest in effectively using solar energy then in finding more non-renewables.   C. I’m speaking on this subject because I see a future where we use free, environmentally safe energy and instead of depending on non-renewable resources use energy that is clean and will never run out.   D.    1. Beginning with why environmentally safe, and clean energy is not only smarter, but more helpful to a greener earth.    2. Continuing on, solar energy is renewable and less likely to run out.    3. Less we depend on foreign resources the better we can make our country. The sun is free. II. First main point   A. The resources we use today are damaging to the environment. We only help ourselves to inevitably hurt ourselves in the future by polluting harmful toxins into our air. If we only use solar energy such as solar panels they don’t give off any type of pollution so it’s all clean.   B. Also, if we only take in the sun’s energy we aren’t taking out anything. According to S. Mekhelif in an article in 2011 he said “It is very important to apply solar energy for a wide variety of applications and provide energy solutions by modifying the energy proportion, improving energy stability, increasing energy sustainability, conversion reduction and hence enhance the system efficiency.” If we can leave the earth alone and depend on cleaner renewable resources we won’t have to continue drilling into earth removing some of its good qualities.   C. “It is pointed out that in 1970 the total energy consumed by the U.S. was equal to the energy of sunlight received by only 0.15% of the land area of the continental U.S.” (Williams J. R., 1974) III.  Second Main Point   A. Solar energy is renewable so if we run out of sun we won’t live anymore anyways. We can save money and other nonrenewable resources by using less equipment on getting our non-renewables. If we depend on renewable resources we are no longer in an energy crisis and can worry about other affairs.   B. The more we can depend on the sun the better because there is nothing more energy efficient or powerful than the sun.   C. Solar energy is free to use. IV. Third Main Point   A. The more we can harness solar energy the less we have to depend on foreign oil which seems to not only be safer to the environment, but also safer to our country. We continue to be in countries where we are not wanted and we are more likely to cause trouble than we are to help when depending on others instead of ourselves. No country can survive on others without some kind of repercussion and the sooner we are out of those kind of situations the better.   B. We can teach other countries to use solar energy helping poor countries become more stable and wealthy countries to continue growth.   C. The sun is a free, stable energy resource and that’s what countries should be built on. V. Conclusion   A. Finally we can see that our energy resources and habits are wrong and can not only be greatly improved, but changed completely for the better. Depending on something dependable is a must if the world expects to go on much longer.   B. Altogether we have learned that solar energy is much more environmentally friendly, and cleaner. Also, dependable and renewable. Lastly free and much more helpful to our country and its future.   C. Something important to take away from all this information is that if we can depend on the sun and reap its benefits.  References 1.Kalogriou, Soteris. A. (October 25, 2013). Google Books.

Also, resistance training done as active recovery does not leave you more sore, stretching would leave you more sore, as the micro trauma that is already caused by the eccentric loading, is further damaged by elongating the muscle.  And your idea about activating a muscle with your mind, yea. Your neural system is going to be more active with a load than it could ever be without one. More muscle would be activated pumping more blood into the damaged tissues.   This is not any sort of new science, just pick up any exercise physiology book that is made later than the 90s. While stretching was traditionally done for active recovery, it is not cause any significant reduction of soreness, or reduce chance of injury in most people.

They are. It is being tested, and chemicals based on it are being sold, although most have not yet come to market. Remember that cannabinoid research is very young, with March 29, 2001 as the seminal ""dies mirabilis"" when the biological relevance was established. Furthermore we know the research has been obstructed due to the war on drugs. There is no mystery as to why it hasn't been investigated enough despite its promise. The weight of evidence is enough that research is now being done despite all the taboo and outright obstructionism, but that takes time. Unfortunately the first wave of research into synthetic cannabinoids for preventing obesity and diabetes was looking at cannabinoid antagonists, which it was then found cause severe psychiatric side effects. Hopefully more experiments with agonists, both synthetic and plant based, are performed in the months and years to come.  Here's a study looking at cannabis in crohn's specifically; it has others in its bibliography. I apologise for not linking it right away; I was inserting citations from my annotated bibliography from a project which is primarily focused on the brain. https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512",0,2016-03-24T21:51:41.000Z,0.136726190476,0.463670634921,en,others,http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512,False,False

Broccoli has long been considered a ""super food,"" but it is sulforaphane, a concentrated form of the phytochemicals found in broccoli sprouts, that’s shaping up to be the true disease fighter.  Studies looking at the supplement for treating and preventing cancer are very promising, said Duxin Sun, a pharmaceutical researcher at the University of Michigan. In one study, sulforaphane was able to reduce the size and number of breast cancer cells while also blocking tumor growth. “We have shown that it can stop the growth of cancer stem cells to inhibit the growth of onco genes, and may also induce the production of detox enzymes to prevent cancer,” Sun said in an interview with ABC News.  The  cancer-fighting power of broccoli has been proved on various occasions, ever since studies in the mid-1990s showed that the broccoli compound glucoraphanin, which is a precursor to sulforaphane, boosts cell enzymes that protect against molecular damage from cancer-causing chemicals....

In recent studies, scientists found evidence that drinking tea, could drastically lower your risk of developing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's disease. If you’re not a tea drinker, it might be time to pick up the healthy habit!  Alzheimer's disease is the most common neuro-degenerative disease in humans, and a leading cause of dementia.  Parkinson's disease is the second most common neuro-degenerative disease, and involves the death of dopamine producing neurons in the brain.  Multiple studies show that the catechin compounds in green tea, can have various protective effects on neurons in test tubes and animal models, lowering the risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's........

This increases the risk of disease transmission in highly vaccinated populations.” https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/208/1/10/796786  Repeatedly, the Measles vaccines do not work! “An outbreak of measles occurred in a high school with a documented vaccination level of 98 per cent.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646939/ “Vaccination coverage for the population was 99%.

This high percentage of individuals having long term immunity has been compromised by mass vaccination of children which provides at best 70 to 90% immunity that is temporary and of unknown duration—shifting chickenpox to a more vulnerable adult population where chickenpox carries 20 times more risk of death and 15 times more risk of hospitalization compared to children. Add to this the adverse effects of both the chickenpox and shingles vaccines as well as the potential for increased risk of shingles for an estimated 30 to 50 years among adults. The Universal Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccination Program now requires booster vaccines; however, these are less effective than the natural immunity that existed in communities prior to licensure of the varicella vaccine.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22659447  *Mercks thought epidemics were such a great idea for more profits, they deliberately spread them but got caught out by two whistleblowers;* http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/merck-whistleblowers_b_5881914.html https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/mmpl79tu/pennsylvania-eastern-district-court/united-states-of-america-et-al-v-merck-and-co/ https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/well/family/mumps-makes-a-comeback-even-among-the-vaccinated.html  There's increasing evidence that viral infections can lead to diabetes by triggering autoimmune reactions, _and vaccinations have been found to result in autoimmune reactions._ Getting diabetes from a vaccine shot is probably a lot more common than people realise.

Almonds can do a world of good when it comes to your health, because they are packed with essential vitamins and minerals like vitamin E, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids.  An enzyme inhibitor in the skin is contained in dry almonds, which is basically meant to protect the seed till it gets moisture for germination. This enzyme inhibitor is released once the almonds are soaked in water.  Eating pre-soaked almonds makes them easier to digest and also makes more nutrients available for digestion. In fact, most nuts and seeds are easier to digest, and have better nutrient availability when soaked overnight before consumption.  Here are several benefits of eating soaked almonds daily:  1. Healthy Heart. The mono-unsaturated fats, protein and potassium present in almonds are good for your heart. Vitamin E reduces the risk of heart diseases and magnesium prevents heart attacks. Almonds also have the ability to reduce artery damaging inflammation.  2. Boosts Body With Massive Amounts of Energy and Nutrients. The best way to boost energy levels is munching on a handful of almonds everyday. It helps in energy production and metabolic rate because of manganese, copper, phosphorus, and riboflavin present in it...........

Optimal low-density lipoprotein is 50 to 70 mg/dl: lower is better and physiologically normal. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004 Jun 2;43(11):2142-6.  P.S. The level for healthy babies is around 30.  The authors above also note that, aside from some domesticated animals, humans are the only mammals with LDL level above 80 and total cholesterol levels above 160. They also note that “symptomatic and fatal atherosclerosis is extremely uncommon in societies where serum total cholesterol levels are <150mg/dL and serum LDL cholesterol levels are <100 mg/dL.” Figure 2 in that study shows the regression line for plaque progression from the various statin trials to lower LDL, showing that atherosclerosis would stop progressing entirely around 67 (One study got close but didn't quite get it down to 70. The caption for Figure 2 is “Atherosclerosis progression varies directly with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This regression line indicates that atherosclerosis does not progress when LDL is 67 mg/dL or below.”   That collection of statin studies show that at progressively higher LDL levels, plaque builds up faster and faster in our arteries. Of course this is an approximation at this point, and it's using fasting LDL, but perhaps someone eating a very low-fat whole food vegan diet could perhaps have an LDL of 75 or 80 and see no progression of atherosclerosis (my reasoning is that the people in most statin trials are still eating a quite atherogenic diet that spikes their LDL after most meals, but someone eating a low-fat WFPB diet wouldn't see any such spike--meaning they aren't flooding their arteries regularly with excess cholesterol that, in the absence of something better to do, winds up making our arterial plaques thicker and our arteries progressively more clogged.",0,2017-09-06T20:19:51.000Z,0.17747942386799995,0.470770813549,en,pmid,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15172426,False,False
