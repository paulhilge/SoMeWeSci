I didnt cherry pick the two closest years)   Thats an 8-11% difference. 24-29% calories coming from fat is a HIGH FAT diet. All they did was look at a high fat diet compared to a higher fat diet and didnt see any significant differences.  They also said that only total fat was decreased (not satur or trans fat), which means both groups could have been eating the same amount of saturated and trans fats.  For instance ""low fat"" group could eat a steak and a salad, while high fat could eat a steak and salad with half an avocado. Obviously theyre not going to have huge differences in health unless the ""low fat"" group exchanges the steak for an avocado, which I guarantee you they did not. Read the fine print people:  “This study shows that just reducing total fat intake does not go far enough to have an impact on heart disease risk. While the participants’ overall change in LDL “bad” cholesterol was small, we saw trends towards greater reductions in cholesterol and heart disease risk in women eating less saturated and trans fat,” said Jacques Rossouw, M.D., WHI project officer. wait, what was that? LESS SATURATED/TRANS FAT = LESS CHOLESTEROL AND HEART DISEASE  (no sat/trans fat= no heart disease btw (well, as long as you stay away from some other stuff as well))   ""The study also found that following a high-carbohydrate, low-fat eating pattern DOES NOT increase body weight, triglycerides or indicators of increased risk of diabetes such as blood glucose or insulin levels in women.""

NASA has recently shown how Arsenic can substitute for Phosphorus as an RNA linker to polymerize it into RNA sequences without any need for ""helper"" proteins or catalysts. Basically there's now nothing missing from the recipe for abiogenesis to proceed under completely natural conditions. Amino acids & nucleotides form naturally, they are able to form linkages without designed catalysts. Short sequences are shown to self replicate. The rest is just proper circumstances.  These microbes THRIVED in a Phosphorus free environment. It's not just the phosphorus on the DNA that got swapped but every Phosphorus using molecule in the cell. For instance the cell membrane consists ofPhospholipid bilayers. It must be constructed substituting Arsenic. The power molecules for EVERY active function of any cell are ADP & ATP, (the P stands for Phosphorus).  This is a much bigger deal than it is made out to be.  There are scenarios where RNA chains are formed by contact with various naturally occurring catalysts. These chains can be randomly disconnected by sunlight. Broken chain segments can be rejoined to other chain segments which almost always does nothing interesting.

He also states that Talk Origins misrepresents the “facts”. Throughout this video he constantly refers to the facts however he never makes it quite clear what facts he is talking about. From 1:00 to 2:06, AbusiveAntiTheist (AAT) explains what ERVs are and explains that the animals we are closely related to share more of the same ERVs than animals we are not closely related to. OFNF then concedes that AAT’s explanation would be reasonable if evolution were true. Obviously, OFNF does not consider evolution true. Keep in mind that the explanation AAT gave in this video is an explanation showing that organisms that are closely related will have more similarities than organisms that are less related. Also, keep in mind how vague the notion that “many similarities between organisms indicate that they are closely related while fewer similarities between animals indicate that they are less closely related” is. Though this notion is a very, very, very rudimentary notion used in regards to evolution, it is not specific as the more complicated reasoning behind the theory of evolution. OFNF attacks this extremely vague notion and uses his criticism of the notion to attack the whole theory of evolution. This is a clear example of straw-manning a position if there ever was one. This will be made clear later on. At 3:30 he makes a distinction between the facts and the interpretation of the facts. He concedes that there are many similarities between organisms at 3:36. However, he does not concede that the fact that animals have similarities implies that animals who share many similarities are closely related. In fact, he states that such an assumption is merely an interpretation of the fact that organisms possess many similarities. He seems to believe that the phylogenetic tree is based solely on the vague assumption that the more similarities that animals have then the more they are related while the less similarities animals have between each other indicates that they are less related. However, he never elaborates on what he means by “similarities” and he never elaborates on what specific animals he is talking about until later on. Well, he sort of elaborates later on. He also claims that “evolutionists” only teach one side of the story as if there is some sort of valid alternative to evolution in the discipline of biology. He also claims that “evolutionists” go through great lengths to ban the controversy regarding evolution from being taught in the class room. He also states that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence while keeping contrary evidence out of the class room. He again states that the “facts” state otherwise. At this point this is where we sort of get into the details. OFNF goes on to cite an article titled “Rewriting Evolution: Tiny molecules called microRNAs are tearing apart traditional ideas about the animal family tree.” as an example of “evolutionists” ignoring contrary evidence. Humorously, he highlights the part of the title that states that microRNA is changing the order of the family tree of evolution yet ignores that the title implies that evolution will still be true being that the title says that evolution is being rewritten and not being shown to be false. He then quotes a part of the article which includes molecular paleobiologist at Dartmouth College, Kevin Peterson’s own words.   “’I’ve looked at thousands of microRNA genes, and I can’t find a single example that would support the traditional tree,” he says. The technique “just changes everything about our understanding of mammal evolution’.”   Here we see another sign of the inconsistency of OFNF’s reasoning. Earlier in the video he stated that evolutionists ignore contrary evidence to evolution yet OFNF cites Peterson (someone he considers an evolutionist) that deals directly with evidence that OFNF considers contrary to evolution. The rest of the article cites other evolutionists who are not ignoring what OFNF considers contrary evidence. This is a tad bit hilarious. He claims that evolutionists are ignoring contrary evidence yet cites a whole article of “evolutionists” not ignoring the very data that OFNF feels is contrary to evolution.  Even funnier is that nothing in the article is contrary to evolution. The article states that Peterson’s findings are contrary to the traditional evolutionary branches on the evolutionary tree yet Peterson’s evidence still supports an evolutionary tree. For example, the article OFNF cites shows a picture of a side-by-side comparison of the traditional evolutionary tree of placental mammals and Kevin Peterson’s evolutionary tree of placental mammals on the PDF of the article. What OFNF fails to communicate is that the two different branches in the side-by-side comparison still show that placental mammals are still a closely related family on their own branch no matter which branch is correct on this side-by-side comparison. Essentially, it is the order and placement of twigs on the branch that is in question. It is not evolution that is in question. Peterson’s evidence is still in support of evolution. OFNF’s claim that there is controversy within the biological community is overstated. If anything the article is great news because it shows that we are improving our understanding of biological evolution. If Peterson is right then we will only make the theory of evolution a stronger theory. If Peterson is wrong then it still makes the theory of evolution a stronger theory. It is a win-win situation being that Peterson’s evidence supports evolution anyways. However, Peterson’s data has not yet been confirmed as the article states.   At 5:06 OFNF continues on to state that in order to get published in peer-reviewed scientific journals one’s results have to line up with the theory of evolution regardless if your data is irrefutable. According to OFNF, if your data doesn’t line up with evolution then your work doesn’t get published and people will have a bias against you. OFNF then supports his assertion by quote mining the article at 5:21. Quote:   “At first, Peterson and Sempere had a tough time publishing their results suggesting that animals had accumulated regulatory microRNAs. ‘One of the reviewers said it was impossible, what we were describing,’ says Peterson.”   OFNF seems to gloss over the two sentences right after the quote he cites that states that Peterson’s papers were eventually published.   “In the end, the work was published in a specialized zoology journal. Subsequent papers, however, won over some sceptics and Peterson was soon publishing in Nature and Science”   Keep in mind that Nature and Science are very prestigious and mainstream science journals that did not ignore Peterson’s findings.   Furthermore, Peterson’s papers were not initially rejected because his data did not align with the theory of evolution. His data was rejected because it was brand new data that has never been seen at the time, period. This is how science works. New data must survive tons of scrutiny before getting published so as to maintain a high standard within the discipline. Sometimes new data gets rejected a few times when going through the peer-review process before finally gaining acceptance. The peer-review process is exactly how Newton and Einstein’s findings gained acceptance. Their findings were scrutinized and sometimes rejected but soon gained acceptance. Peterson’s findings gained acceptance the same way. OFNF then states that creationists have their own scientific journals because of this alleged bias. However, it is clear that OFNF is wrong. He then quotes the same article but only quotes those that disagree with Peterson’s findings. OFNF does not show you the quotes that show that not everyone in the same field as Peterson disagrees with Peterson. After all, Peterson would not have been able to get published if no one agreed with him. Nonetheless, here’s a quote from the same article OFNF quote mines that shows that others agree with Peterson’s microRNA findings:    “That has won him many critics, but also some strong supporters. ‘Peterson and his col­leagues have demonstrated that microRNAs are a powerful tool in determining the rela­tionships of major animal groups,’ says Derek Briggs, director of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, Connecticut.”       Elsewhere in the article, evolutionary bioinformatician, Peter Stadler agrees:   “‘It is a really clever and fresh approach to phylogeny,’ says Peter Stadler, an evolutionary bioinformatician at the University of Leipzig in Germany. ‘I don’t quite know why pres­ence/absence of microRNAs is not used more frequently in deep phylogeny approaches.’”   It is clear that scientists are divided on this matter and it is clear that the matter is a work in progress as the article indicates.   OFNF then quotes an abstract of a paper entitled the “Gene tree discordance, phylogenetic inference and the multispecies coalescent”. This is a sophomore move from OFNF. A simple Wikipedia search will show that abstracts are very limited and that the full article should be consulted. Consulting an abstract alone is inadequate when trying to get the full picture. Based on what OFNF quoted from the abstract, Wikipedia is actually right. What OFNF forgiven quoted from the abstract is not very specific at all. At 6:48 OFNF quotes from the abstract stating:   “…conflicting genealogical histories often exist in different genes throughout the genome…resolving close species relationships is not quite as simple as applying more data to the problem.”   From these two statements and a small quote from the article OFNF claims that the article shows genetic trees are different depending on what set of genetic data one looks at but he does not elaborate to what extent the trees are changed. Is the entire evolutionary tree different such that bees fall on a twig on the evolutionary branch of placental mammals or are the differences in genetic trees minor such that tiny twigs of closely related species fall on different places of slightly bigger twig but still strongly support the theory of evolution? OFNF never elaborates on this. However, the abstract OFNF quotes states that resolving [close] species relationships is not simple which indicates that the major branches on the evolutionary tree are well confirmed but it is the minute details of the twigs on this tree which needs further investigation and refining. In other words, the evolutionary tree has been demonstrated. At 8:10, OFNF cites the paper titled “Mapping Human Genetic Ancestry” (http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/10/2266.full.pdf+html), and uses the paper to argue against evolution. The paper does state that human evolution is not entirely certain but the paper does state that human evolution did occur. It is also certain that the great apes are closely related and share a common ancestor as is shown in table 2 and 3 of the paper. The paper also doesn’t ignore the incongruent data. The paper actually addresses the data directly and admits to the incongruent data though OFNF ignores that while once again falsely claiming that contrary data is ignored. It seems like it is OFNF that is ignoring the data. OFNF also states that phylogenetic trees cannot be used to prove the family tree but he fails to realize that they are one in the same. He also fails to realize that the family tree cannot be proven because new data can always turn up which could change current phylogeny (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/phylogenetics_05). In fact, no science is ever proven exactly because new data can always change current scientific knowledge. All scientific theories are tentative so it is nonsensical for OFNF to ask for the family tree to be proven. The evolutionary tree has already been demonstrated anyways. At 9:38 OFNF quotes the article with Kevin Peterson once again and asserts that AAT is only paying attention to what conforms to AAT’s supposedly preconceived notion that the theory of evolution is correct a priori. However, I have already shown how OFNF has grossly misrepresented the article which renders his charge against ATT superfluous. OFNF then moves on to talk about ERVs but OFNF doesn’t just talk about ERVs, he grossly misrepresents what ERVs tell us about evolution. OFNF argues that it is very likely that chimps and humans would share identical ERV sites while still acquiring ERV cites independently because there are so many cites (~30,000) in human DNA and ERV cites do not occur in random spots. Even granting OFNFs constraints, his argument still does not explain why only specific species share the same exact ERV cites that others do not. For instance, the HERV-K insertion is only shared among various primates. Also, small cats (e.g. the jungle cat, European wildcat, African wildcat, blackfooted cat, and domestic cat) under the family Felidae all share a specific retrogene insertion not found in any other carnivore. Is OFNF going to argue that the matching EVR insertions that are exclusive to primates occurred independently for each primate species but match up perfectly by coincidence? How about the ERV insertion that small cats in the Felidae family share? Did that insertion occur independently of every species in that group but just happens to match up perfectly while that same insertion is completely absent from all other animals? I think not. Clearly, he is just trying to discredit evolution even if his objections make no sense. Given that ERVs are only passed down to descendants it is clear that animals that share ERVs are related and small groups of different species that exclusively share ERVs all share common ancestry. Basically, ERVs do support evolution despite OFNF’s objections in this video.

This is a significant contribution in a continent in which gay relationships are criminalised in 38 out of 55 countries, four of which impose the death penalty.  The study used a panel of non-partisan volunteer experts to assess the considerable and often contradictory literature on biological, social and environmental factors in sexual diversity. It is one of the most clear-sighted evaluations that I have encountered, and it deserves to be taken very seriously in Africa and elsewhere.  A range of sexuality  The nub of the report is its conclusion that diversity in human sexuality is:  … a range of human variation, very little of which can justifiably be termed abnormal. The source of this variation has been contentious for decades, despite the accumulating evidence that nature (“born gay”) is overwhelmingly more significant than nurture (“lifestyle choice”).  The report has a large and readable section on biological factors in homosexuality, including neurohormone effects on the fetus, and “epigenetic” influence on the activity of genes by chemical modifications that can be modified by the environment and are transmitted to all the cells of the individual, and sometimes even between generations.  As the report summarises, family studies over decades show that gay men are more likely than average to have gay brothers, and lesbian women more likely to have lesbian sisters.  Many twin studies showing that identical twins are twice as likely as non-identical twins to be concordant (both straight or both gay) imply a clear genetic component, but the 70% concordance leaves room for considerable non-genetic effect. This is true whether or not the twins were raised together.  A 1993 report of a gay gene on the X chromosome has been recently confirmed by a larger study, with the addition of another one or two gay genes.  To me, the most compelling argument that homosexuality is just one end of a normal spectrum is its prediction by evolutionary theory, which I have explored in detail previously.  Knowing about the wide variety of sexual behaviours in the animal kingdom, we can understand human sexuality in a broader context than our own society. It would be truly remarkable if humans had evolved without strong selection for mate choice genes.  Mate choice is one of the most highly selected traits in any animal. Just ask a fruitfly, which devotes a large share of its genes to choosing and attracting a mate.  Not gay genes, but male-loving variants  As I wrote previously, I think there will turn out to be many – maybe hundreds – of gay genes. But these should be considered “male-loving” variants of mate choice genes. In a female, a male-loving variant will induce her to mate earlier and have more children, making up for her gay brother. Makes sense.  I was happy to see in the report a discussion of data showing that the female relatives of gay males have more children than average women, thus preventing the gay gene from extincting itself.  There is so far no evidence for a “female-loving” variant that induces the brothers of lesbians to have more children, but it would be surprising if there weren’t many of them too.  We know of many “sexually antagonistic” genetic variants like this, which have opposite effects on the “genetic fitness” (that is, numbers of children) of males and females.  So, everyone has a grand mixture of male- and female-loving variants. This explains why there is such a broad spectrum of mate preference among both males and females.  It’s a bit like height, in which there are variants of many genes (estimates of more than 1000) predisposing to tall or short stature. Everyone – males and females – has a mixture. Some males and some females will be either very short or very tall, but most will be somewhere in the middle.  In the same way, I propose that there is a distribution from the very male-loving to the very female-loving among both males and females. Gays and lesbian people simply represent one extremes at one end of this distribution. Hypersexualised heterosexual males and females represent the other end.  Perhaps even more importantly, the report rejects the concepts that homosexuality is learned from, or results from behaviour of parents or peers, that it can rub off on others, and that it can be “treated”.  The report concludes that:  Contemporary science increasingly recognises the wide range of natural variation in human sexuality, sexual orientations and gender identities. The report argues that it is important for countries to accept that sexual diversity is normal. There are severe consequences of persecuting and criminalising LGBTI, and not just directly for individuals and particular communities.  By persecuting, marginalising and criminalising whole sets of sexual behaviour, societies as a whole may quickly lose the public health battle against HIV-AIDS and other sexual health scourges, experience higher levels of social violence, and ignore other serious issues like violence against women and children.   Uganda’s Constitutional Court nullified an anti-homosexuality law in August 2014. Reuters/Edward Echwalu The politics of homosexuality and role of science academies  It could be said that ASSAf has gone way beyond its scientific limitations by summarising its findings as:  Sexual diversity has always been part of a normal society and there is no justification for attempts to eliminate people who are not heterosexual from society. Efforts should rather be focused on countering the stigmatisation that creates hostile and violent environments. Alternatively, this report may be criticised for not going far enough down the political path to removing criminal sanctions, stigma and persecution. However, every academy – including the Australian Academy of Science – must jealously guard its non-partisan reputation in order to be taken seriously.  ASSAf’s mandate is “to provide evidence-based science advice to government and other stakeholders on matters of critical national importance”. I believe ASSAf has done this. It is now up to other bodies to use the clearly stated scientific conclusions as a sharp-edged weapon to dispel myths and repel bigots.  It is often said that it is ineffective to fight illogical fears and hatreds with facts and logic, and it is sadly true that common sense and respect for data don’t always win out – think climate change and vaccination. But academies of science would risk their reputations, and mortgage their influence with governments of any persuasion, were they to go down the track of fighting irrational fear with emotive appeals.    http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/the-two-spirit-people-of-indigenous-north-americans.html   Native Americans have often held intersex, androgynous people, feminine males and masculine females in high respect. The most common term to define such persons today is to refer to them as ""two-spirit"" people, but in the past feminine males were sometimes referred to as ""berdache"" by early French explorers in North America, who adapted a Persian word ""bardaj"", meaning an intimate male friend. Because these androgynous males were commonly married to a masculine man, or had sex with men, and the masculine females had feminine women as wives, the term berdache had a clear homosexual connotation. Both the Spanish settlers in Latin America and the English colonists in North America condemned them as ""sodomites"".  We-Wa, a Zuni Two Spirit.Rather than emphasising the homosexuality of these persons, however, many Native Americans focused on their spiritual gifts. American Indian traditionalists, even today, tend to see a person's basic character as a reflection of their spirit. Since everything that exists is thought to come from the spirit world, androgynous or transgender persons are seen as doubly blessed, having both the spirit of a man and the spirit of a woman. Thus, they are honoured for having two spirits, and are seen as more spiritually gifted than the typical masculine male or feminine female.  Therefore, many Native American religions, rather than stigmatising such persons, often looked to them as religious leaders and teachers. Quite similar religious traditions existed among the native peoples of Siberia and many parts of Central and southeast Asia. Since the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Siberia over 20,000 years ago, and since reports of highly respected androgynous persons have been noted among indigenous Americans from Alaska to Chile, androgyny seems to be quite ancient among humans.  A Two Spirit.Rather than the physical body, Native Americans emphasised a person's ""spirit"", or character, as being most important. Instead of seeing two-spirit persons as transsexuals who try to make themselves into ""the opposite sex"", it is more accurate to understand them as individuals who take on a gender status that is different from both men and women. This alternative gender status offers a range of possibilities, from slightly effeminate males or masculine females, to androgynous or transgender persons, to those who completely cross-dress and act as the other gender. The emphasis of Native Americans is not to force every person into one box, but to allow for the reality of diversity in gender and sexual identities.  Most of the evidence for respectful two-spirit traditions is focused on the native peoples of the Plains, the Great Lakes, the Southwest, and California. With over a thousand vastly different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, it is important not to overgeneralise for the indigenous peoples of North America. Some documentary sources suggest that a minority of societies treated two-spirit persons disrespectfully, by kidding them or discouraging children from taking on a two-spirit role. However, many of the documents that report negative reactions are themselves suspect, and should be evaluated critically in light of the preponderance of evidence that suggests a respectful attitude. Some European commentators, from early frontier explorers to modern anthropologists, also were influenced by their own homophobic prejudices to distort native attitudes.  Another photograph of We-Wa, a Zuni two-spirit, weaving. Two-spirit people were respected by native societies not only due to religious attitudes, but also because of practical concerns. Because their gender roles involved a mixture of both masculine and feminine traits, two-spirit persons could do both the work of men and of women. They were often considered to be hard workers and artistically gifted, of great value to their extended families and community. Among some groups, such as the Navajo, a family was believed to be economically benefited by having a ""nadleh"" (literally translated as ""one who is transformed"") androgynous person as a relative. Two-spirit persons assisted their siblings' children and took care of elderly relatives, and often served as adoptive parents for homeless children.  A Two Spirit known as We-Wa.A feminine male who preferred to do women's work (gathering wild plants or farming domestic plants) was logically expected to marry a masculine male, who did men's work (hunting and warfare). Because a family needed both plant foods and meat, a masculine female hunter, in turn, usually married a feminine female, to provide these complementary gender roles for economic survival. The gender-conforming spouse of two-spirit people did not see themselves as ""homosexual"" or as anything other than ""normal"".  In the 20th-century, as homophobic European Christian influences increased among many Native Americans, respect for same-sex love and for androgynous persons greatly declined. Two-spirit people were often forced, either by government officials, Christian missionaries or their own community, to conform to standard gender roles. Some, who could not conform, either went underground or committed suicide. With the imposition of Euro-American marriage laws, same-sex marriages between two-spirit people and their spouses were no longer legally recognised. But with the revitalisation of Native American ""red power"" cultural pride since the 60s, and the rise of gay and lesbian liberation movements at the same time, a new respect for androgyny started slowly re-emerging among American Indian people.  Because of this tradition of respect, in the 90s many gay and lesbian Native American activists in the United States and Canada rejected the French word berdache in favour of the term two-spirit people to describe themselves. Many non-American Indians have incorporated knowledge of Native American two-spirit traditions into their increasing acceptance of same-sex love, androgyny and transgender diversity. Native American same-sex marriages have been used as a model for legalising same-sex marriages, and the spiritual gifts of androgynous persons have started to become more recognised.   @953627434  Gay marriage sounds like an ultra-contemporary idea. But almost twenty years ago, a Catholic scholar at Yale shocked the world by publishing a book packed with evidence that same-sex marriages were sanctioned by the early Christian Church during an era commonly called the Dark Ages.  Illustration of Serge and Bacchus, in a same-sex union  John Boswell was a historian and religious Catholic who dedicated much of his scholarly life to studying the late Roman Empire and early Christian Church. Poring over legal and church documents from this era, he discovered something incredible. There were dozens of records of church ceremonies where two men were joined in unions that used the same rituals as heterosexual marriages. (He found almost no records of lesbian unions, which is probably an artifact of a culture which kept more records about the lives of men generally.)  Bolstered by this evidence, Boswell published a book in 1994, the year before his death from AIDS, called Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe. The book comes out next month for the first time in a digital edition. It was an instant lightening rod for controversy, drawing criticism from both the Catholic Church and sex pundit Camille Paglia. Given the Church's present-day views on gay marriage, these detractors argued, Boswell's history seemed like wishful thinking.     But it wasn't. Boswell had actually begun his research back in the 1970s, and published an equally controversial work in 1980 called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century. His Same-Sex Unions book refined and expanded a lot of what he'd learned over a lifetime of research into primary sources in scattered libraries and archives.    How could these marriages have been forgotten by history? One easy answer is that — as Boswell argues — the Church reframed the idea of marriage in the 13th century to be for the purposes of procreation. And this slammed the door on gay marriage. Church scholars and officials worked hard to suppress the history of these marriages in order to justify their new definition.  Of course, history is more complicated than that. Boswell claims that part of the problem is that we define marriage so differently today that it's almost impossible for historians to recognize 1800-year-old gay marriage documents when they see them. Often, these documents refer to uniting ""brothers,"" which at the time would have been a way of describing same-sex partners whose lifestyles were tolerated in Rome. Also, marriages over a millennium ago were not based on procreation, but wealth-sharing. So ""marriage"" sometimes meant a non-sexual union of two people's or families' wealth. Boswell admits that some of the documents he found may refer simply to non-sexual joining of two men's fortunes — but many also referred to what today we would call gay marriage.  Gay marriage in the year 100 AD Legal scholar Richard Ante wrote a law journal article explaining that Boswell's book could even be used as evidence for the legality of gay marriage, since it shows evidence that definitions of marriage have changed over time. He describes some of Boswell's evidence of these same-sex rites in the early first millennium:  The burial rite given for Achilles and Patroclus, both men, was the burial rite for a man and his wife. The relationships of Hadrian and Antinous, of Polyeuct and Nearchos, of Perpetua and Felicitas, and of Saints Serge and Bacchus, all bore resemblance to heterosexual marriages of their times. The iconography of Serge and Bacchus was even used in same-sex nuptial ceremonies by the early Christian Church. The main piece of evidence that these same-sex unions were marriages is that they so closely resembled heterosexual ceremonies. Literary scholar Bruce Holsinger describes Boswell's detailed stories of same-sex ceremonies:  [Boswell] cleverly posits the development of heterosexual and same-sex nuptial offices as a single phenomenon, tracking the growth of the latter from ""merely a set of prayers "" in the earlier Middle Ages to its flowering as a ""full office"" by the twelfth century that involved ""the burning of candles, the placing of the two parties' hands on the Gospel, the joining of their right hands, the binding of their hands . . . with the priest's stole, an introductory litany crowning, the Lord's Prayer, Communion, a kiss, and sometimes circling around the altar."" Boswell devotes a full chapter to comparing these rituals with their heterosexual counterparts, revealing a number of extraordinary similarities between the two; in several appendixes totaling almost 100 pages, he has compiled numerous examples of the documents themselves (including heterosexual matrimony ceremonies and adoption rituals for comparison) to let ""readers . . . judge for themselves,"" as he puts it. (Boswell translates most of the ceremonies, so general readers won't have to worry about brushing up on their Old Church Slavonic.) Were these same-sex unions in the middle ages the same thing as today's gay marriages? Probably not. People at the time may not have viewed two men forming a union as anything out of the ordinary. Marriage itself meant something different thousands of years ago, and social taboos against homosexuality had not yet solidified. Still, in Boswell's work, we find records of institutions where same-sex couples were honored with the same ceremonies that opposite-sex couples enjoyed. Two men could live as ""brothers,"" sharing wealth, home, and family. And yes, they could love each other, too.  Though Boswell died before his country began to allow similar kinds of unions, he could draw hope from knowing something that most people did not. Even the most fundamental kinds of human relationships change over time. Those who have been banished today may be blessed tomorrow — just as they were over a thousand years ago.",0,2015-06-23T22:56:36.000Z,0.156675569942,0.427638173987,en,theconversation,http://theconversation.com/african-scientists-recognise-that-diverse-sexuality-is-the-norm-43050,False,False,http://theconversation.com/african-scientists-recognise-that-diverse-sexuality-is-the-norm-43050

Official documents obtained from the UK Department of Health (DH) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) reveal that the British health authorities have been engaging in such practice for the last 30 years, apparently for the sole purpose of protecting the national vaccination program.  The author, Dr Lucija Tomljenovic writes:  Here I present the documentation which appears to show that the JCVI made continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and contraindications to vaccinations to both parents and health practitioners in order to reach overall vaccination rates which they deemed were necessary for “herd immunity”, a concept which with regards to vaccination, and contrary to prevalent beliefs, does not rest on solid scientific evidence as will be explained. As a result of such vaccination policy promoted by the JCVI and the DH, many children have been vaccinated without their parents being disclosed the critical information about demonstrated risks of serious adverse reactions, one that the JCVI appeared to have been fully aware of. It would also appear that, by withholding this information, the JCVI/DH neglected the right of individuals to make an informed consent concerning vaccination. By doing so, the JCVI/DH may have violated not only International Guidelines for Medical Ethics (i.e., Helsinki Declaration and the International Code of Medical Ethics) [2] but also, their own Code of Practice.  Dr Lucija Tomljenovic continues:  The transcripts of the JCVI meetings also show that some of the Committee members had extensive ties to pharmaceutical companies and that the JCVI frequently co-operated with vaccine manufacturers on strategies aimed at boosting vaccine uptake. Some of the meetings at which such controversial items were discussed were not intended to be publicly available, as the transcripts were only released later, through the Freedom of Information Act (FOI). These particular meetings are denoted in the transcripts as “commercial in confidence”, and reveal a clear and disturbing lack of transparency, as some of the information was removed from the text (i.e., the names of the participants) prior to transcript release under the FOI section at the JCVI website (for example, JCVI CSM/DH (Committee on the Safety of Medicines/Department of Health) Joint Committee on Adverse Reactions Minutes 1986-1992).  http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-vaccine-coverup-30-years-of-secret-official-transcripts-show-uk-government-experts-cover-up-vaccine-hazards-to-sell-more-vaccines-and-harm-your-kids/5354241",0,2016-01-08T03:21:41.000Z,0.0735653235653,0.412026862027,en,globalresearch,http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-vaccine-coverup-30-years-of-secret-official-transcripts-show-uk-government-experts-cover-up-vaccine-hazards-to-sell-more-vaccines-and-harm-your-kids/5354241,False,False,http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-vaccine-coverup-30-years-of-secret-official-transcripts-show-uk-government-experts-cover-up-vaccine-hazards-to-sell-more-vaccines-and-harm-your-kids/5354241

Then you claimed the interpretations are valid due to the number of available examples that all use the same faulty interpretations. Hence circular reasoning.    You can't claim that a skull reconstruction is valid evidence for evolution based on fragments and evolutionary presuppositions. You can't claim ancestor descendant relationships through the shapes of bones. At best its a faith based argument.  So you refuse to look at the downright fraud in evolutionary biology? If you don't think the field should be held responsible for it's blatant fraud then who should? You certainly hold creation responsible for the same thing based on your earlier comments about the discovery institute.   Why couldn't it be an extinct ape? Are you seriously going to claim an ancestor descendant relationship because of a similarity in bone structure? For that matter its just as good evidence for common design.    Dismiss all you want. You're going to dismiss my entire argument anyway regardless of whether I provide evidence or not. You had already dismissed my argument before you even heard it. You don't care what evidence I bring. Your mind is made up already.    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/recent_genetic_research_shows034291.html   Do you know why they use mice as test subjects? Because they're so genetically similar to you. If you didn't know that you shouldn't be arguing on the subject. Seriously.    Well if you're saying genetic similarity Is evidence for common descent Then that must go for bananas too. I'm sorry but that's your argument not mine.   The same link I posted above covers the Neanderthals also. Yes the Neanderthal used to be a transitional form until it was genetically refuted.  How long have you been studying evolutionary biology? It seems like there's a lot of very common knowledge things that you are unaware of.   Many of those defining features in Lucy are not defining features their interpretations of parts that we don't have. Like the feet for instance. We didn't find any bones from the shins down. Therefore the defining feature of human feet doesn't exist it was made up by evolutionists. Later examples of Australopithecus have ape feet. The hip is another made up defining feature. Based on a more recent examples we know that Australopithecus was a knuckle walker.    The only difference between my belief in your beliefs are starting points. You reject the supernatural therefore any conclusion has to be naturalistic. I'm willing to accept the supernatural. We are using the exact same facts and based on our starting point our interpretations come to a different conclusion. Listen, I have a bachelors in science in an IQ of 180. I was evolutionist a year and a half ago. I know all of your arguments and I know the evidence that goes along with it because I use to make the exact same arguments you're making. As soon as I accepted the fact that there is a God and was willing to accept the supernatural my opinions changed. My opinions are based purely on science. You trying to make me look like just some ignorant Christian that doesn't know any better is a fallacy. You're the one that can't come up with evidence to support your position therefore you're talking my position.     I told you you would reject my source. Its like I was saying before. You don't want sources you've already made up your mind. That's why it's a waste of time for me to post links. You will just be demanding the exact same sources from me in two weeks in another thread.   Why don't you provide a source now on a single debate between creationists about where to draw the line of human and ape. Because I think you just made that up. That's blatantly false. The red line is hard and it's not like Obama's red line. lol   So when I make a joke out of your arguments you blame me on using standard creationist arguments. lol. You're making the exact same atheist arguments. In fact many of your arguments are actually outdated considering the evidence that's been found. I'm surprised you haven't brought up the busted 98% genetic similarity in apes. lol.   When have you given me observable example that don't require faith? Simply the fact that I can come up with an argument against your examples shows that it requires faith to believe in it. Irrefutable doesn't mean that only accepted answers are valid.  It means that there's no other explanation but the one given. Facts are the fossils themselves. All you have given me is interpretations of the facts not facts.    Yes it is where the evidence lead me. When I first became a Christian I believed in evolution.  It wasn't until critically looking at the evidence that I changed my position. I have since found the opinion of theistic evolution unreconcilable.

Free will and consciousness are products of the brain. To explain free will, we need to understand how the brain works. The brain transmits electrical and chemical signals through its 100 billions neurons and quadrillion synapses. The Goldman and Nernst equations govern this process of neurotransmission. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postsynaptic_potential These principles are derived from electrochemistry, fluid mechanics and classical electrodynamics. In fact neurotransmission is equivalent to resistance-capacitance circuit in classical electrodynamics. Therefore, it is classical physics not quantum mechanics that governs the brain. Using quantum mechanics to explain free will is like using the theory of relativity in dam engineering. On the other hand: Discovery of quantum vibrations in 'microtubules' inside brain neurons supports controversial theory of consciousness http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm Another interesting argument : Another of Aaronson’s points was that determinism is a two-way street. Our choices can be said to determine the cosmological initial conditions. Therefore even in a fully deterministic universe, we can be said to have free will.

Here's 8 minutes of video proof (& more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists & doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

You can follow up by clicking on ""Sources Cited"". Each citation is a link.

(Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T.

Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die.

But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language.

A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements.

Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")

Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning?

This is a significant contribution in a continent in which gay relationships are criminalised in 38 out of 55 countries, four of which impose the death penalty.  The study used a panel of non-partisan volunteer experts to assess the considerable and often contradictory literature on biological, social and environmental factors in sexual diversity. It is one of the most clear-sighted evaluations that I have encountered, and it deserves to be taken very seriously in Africa and elsewhere.  A range of sexuality  The nub of the report is its conclusion that diversity in human sexuality is:  … a range of human variation, very little of which can justifiably be termed abnormal. The source of this variation has been contentious for decades, despite the accumulating evidence that nature (“born gay”) is overwhelmingly more significant than nurture (“lifestyle choice”).  The report has a large and readable section on biological factors in homosexuality, including neurohormone effects on the fetus, and “epigenetic” influence on the activity of genes by chemical modifications that can be modified by the environment and are transmitted to all the cells of the individual, and sometimes even between generations.  As the report summarises, family studies over decades show that gay men are more likely than average to have gay brothers, and lesbian women more likely to have lesbian sisters.  Many twin studies showing that identical twins are twice as likely as non-identical twins to be concordant (both straight or both gay) imply a clear genetic component, but the 70% concordance leaves room for considerable non-genetic effect. This is true whether or not the twins were raised together.  A 1993 report of a gay gene on the X chromosome has been recently confirmed by a larger study, with the addition of another one or two gay genes.  To me, the most compelling argument that homosexuality is just one end of a normal spectrum is its prediction by evolutionary theory, which I have explored in detail previously.  Knowing about the wide variety of sexual behaviours in the animal kingdom, we can understand human sexuality in a broader context than our own society. It would be truly remarkable if humans had evolved without strong selection for mate choice genes.  Mate choice is one of the most highly selected traits in any animal. Just ask a fruitfly, which devotes a large share of its genes to choosing and attracting a mate.  Not gay genes, but male-loving variants  As I wrote previously, I think there will turn out to be many – maybe hundreds – of gay genes. But these should be considered “male-loving” variants of mate choice genes. In a female, a male-loving variant will induce her to mate earlier and have more children, making up for her gay brother. Makes sense.  I was happy to see in the report a discussion of data showing that the female relatives of gay males have more children than average women, thus preventing the gay gene from extincting itself.  There is so far no evidence for a “female-loving” variant that induces the brothers of lesbians to have more children, but it would be surprising if there weren’t many of them too.  We know of many “sexually antagonistic” genetic variants like this, which have opposite effects on the “genetic fitness” (that is, numbers of children) of males and females.  So, everyone has a grand mixture of male- and female-loving variants. This explains why there is such a broad spectrum of mate preference among both males and females.  It’s a bit like height, in which there are variants of many genes (estimates of more than 1000) predisposing to tall or short stature. Everyone – males and females – has a mixture. Some males and some females will be either very short or very tall, but most will be somewhere in the middle.  In the same way, I propose that there is a distribution from the very male-loving to the very female-loving among both males and females. Gays and lesbian people simply represent one extremes at one end of this distribution. Hypersexualised heterosexual males and females represent the other end.  Perhaps even more importantly, the report rejects the concepts that homosexuality is learned from, or results from behaviour of parents or peers, that it can rub off on others, and that it can be “treated”.  The report concludes that:  Contemporary science increasingly recognises the wide range of natural variation in human sexuality, sexual orientations and gender identities. The report argues that it is important for countries to accept that sexual diversity is normal. There are severe consequences of persecuting and criminalising LGBTI, and not just directly for individuals and particular communities.  By persecuting, marginalising and criminalising whole sets of sexual behaviour, societies as a whole may quickly lose the public health battle against HIV-AIDS and other sexual health scourges, experience higher levels of social violence, and ignore other serious issues like violence against women and children.   Uganda’s Constitutional Court nullified an anti-homosexuality law in August 2014. Reuters/Edward Echwalu The politics of homosexuality and role of science academies  It could be said that ASSAf has gone way beyond its scientific limitations by summarising its findings as:  Sexual diversity has always been part of a normal society and there is no justification for attempts to eliminate people who are not heterosexual from society. Efforts should rather be focused on countering the stigmatisation that creates hostile and violent environments. Alternatively, this report may be criticised for not going far enough down the political path to removing criminal sanctions, stigma and persecution. However, every academy – including the Australian Academy of Science – must jealously guard its non-partisan reputation in order to be taken seriously.  ASSAf’s mandate is “to provide evidence-based science advice to government and other stakeholders on matters of critical national importance”. I believe ASSAf has done this. It is now up to other bodies to use the clearly stated scientific conclusions as a sharp-edged weapon to dispel myths and repel bigots.  It is often said that it is ineffective to fight illogical fears and hatreds with facts and logic, and it is sadly true that common sense and respect for data don’t always win out – think climate change and vaccination. But academies of science would risk their reputations, and mortgage their influence with governments of any persuasion, were they to go down the track of fighting irrational fear with emotive appeals.    http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/the-two-spirit-people-of-indigenous-north-americans.html   Native Americans have often held intersex, androgynous people, feminine males and masculine females in high respect. The most common term to define such persons today is to refer to them as ""two-spirit"" people, but in the past feminine males were sometimes referred to as ""berdache"" by early French explorers in North America, who adapted a Persian word ""bardaj"", meaning an intimate male friend. Because these androgynous males were commonly married to a masculine man, or had sex with men, and the masculine females had feminine women as wives, the term berdache had a clear homosexual connotation. Both the Spanish settlers in Latin America and the English colonists in North America condemned them as ""sodomites"".  We-Wa, a Zuni Two Spirit.Rather than emphasising the homosexuality of these persons, however, many Native Americans focused on their spiritual gifts. American Indian traditionalists, even today, tend to see a person's basic character as a reflection of their spirit. Since everything that exists is thought to come from the spirit world, androgynous or transgender persons are seen as doubly blessed, having both the spirit of a man and the spirit of a woman. Thus, they are honoured for having two spirits, and are seen as more spiritually gifted than the typical masculine male or feminine female.  Therefore, many Native American religions, rather than stigmatising such persons, often looked to them as religious leaders and teachers. Quite similar religious traditions existed among the native peoples of Siberia and many parts of Central and southeast Asia. Since the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Siberia over 20,000 years ago, and since reports of highly respected androgynous persons have been noted among indigenous Americans from Alaska to Chile, androgyny seems to be quite ancient among humans.  A Two Spirit.Rather than the physical body, Native Americans emphasised a person's ""spirit"", or character, as being most important. Instead of seeing two-spirit persons as transsexuals who try to make themselves into ""the opposite sex"", it is more accurate to understand them as individuals who take on a gender status that is different from both men and women. This alternative gender status offers a range of possibilities, from slightly effeminate males or masculine females, to androgynous or transgender persons, to those who completely cross-dress and act as the other gender. The emphasis of Native Americans is not to force every person into one box, but to allow for the reality of diversity in gender and sexual identities.  Most of the evidence for respectful two-spirit traditions is focused on the native peoples of the Plains, the Great Lakes, the Southwest, and California. With over a thousand vastly different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, it is important not to overgeneralise for the indigenous peoples of North America. Some documentary sources suggest that a minority of societies treated two-spirit persons disrespectfully, by kidding them or discouraging children from taking on a two-spirit role. However, many of the documents that report negative reactions are themselves suspect, and should be evaluated critically in light of the preponderance of evidence that suggests a respectful attitude. Some European commentators, from early frontier explorers to modern anthropologists, also were influenced by their own homophobic prejudices to distort native attitudes.  Another photograph of We-Wa, a Zuni two-spirit, weaving. Two-spirit people were respected by native societies not only due to religious attitudes, but also because of practical concerns. Because their gender roles involved a mixture of both masculine and feminine traits, two-spirit persons could do both the work of men and of women. They were often considered to be hard workers and artistically gifted, of great value to their extended families and community. Among some groups, such as the Navajo, a family was believed to be economically benefited by having a ""nadleh"" (literally translated as ""one who is transformed"") androgynous person as a relative. Two-spirit persons assisted their siblings' children and took care of elderly relatives, and often served as adoptive parents for homeless children.  A Two Spirit known as We-Wa.A feminine male who preferred to do women's work (gathering wild plants or farming domestic plants) was logically expected to marry a masculine male, who did men's work (hunting and warfare). Because a family needed both plant foods and meat, a masculine female hunter, in turn, usually married a feminine female, to provide these complementary gender roles for economic survival. The gender-conforming spouse of two-spirit people did not see themselves as ""homosexual"" or as anything other than ""normal"".  In the 20th-century, as homophobic European Christian influences increased among many Native Americans, respect for same-sex love and for androgynous persons greatly declined. Two-spirit people were often forced, either by government officials, Christian missionaries or their own community, to conform to standard gender roles. Some, who could not conform, either went underground or committed suicide. With the imposition of Euro-American marriage laws, same-sex marriages between two-spirit people and their spouses were no longer legally recognised. But with the revitalisation of Native American ""red power"" cultural pride since the 60s, and the rise of gay and lesbian liberation movements at the same time, a new respect for androgyny started slowly re-emerging among American Indian people.  Because of this tradition of respect, in the 90s many gay and lesbian Native American activists in the United States and Canada rejected the French word berdache in favour of the term two-spirit people to describe themselves. Many non-American Indians have incorporated knowledge of Native American two-spirit traditions into their increasing acceptance of same-sex love, androgyny and transgender diversity. Native American same-sex marriages have been used as a model for legalising same-sex marriages, and the spiritual gifts of androgynous persons have started to become more recognised.   http://io9.com/gay-marriage-in-the-year-100-ad-951140108/953627434  Gay marriage sounds like an ultra-contemporary idea. But almost twenty years ago, a Catholic scholar at Yale shocked the world by publishing a book packed with evidence that same-sex marriages were sanctioned by the early Christian Church during an era commonly called the Dark Ages.  Illustration of Serge and Bacchus, in a same-sex union  John Boswell was a historian and religious Catholic who dedicated much of his scholarly life to studying the late Roman Empire and early Christian Church. Poring over legal and church documents from this era, he discovered something incredible. There were dozens of records of church ceremonies where two men were joined in unions that used the same rituals as heterosexual marriages. (He found almost no records of lesbian unions, which is probably an artifact of a culture which kept more records about the lives of men generally.)  Bolstered by this evidence, Boswell published a book in 1994, the year before his death from AIDS, called Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe. The book comes out next month for the first time in a digital edition. It was an instant lightening rod for controversy, drawing criticism from both the Catholic Church and sex pundit Camille Paglia. Given the Church's present-day views on gay marriage, these detractors argued, Boswell's history seemed like wishful thinking.     But it wasn't. Boswell had actually begun his research back in the 1970s, and published an equally controversial work in 1980 called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century. His Same-Sex Unions book refined and expanded a lot of what he'd learned over a lifetime of research into primary sources in scattered libraries and archives.    How could these marriages have been forgotten by history? One easy answer is that — as Boswell argues — the Church reframed the idea of marriage in the 13th century to be for the purposes of procreation. And this slammed the door on gay marriage. Church scholars and officials worked hard to suppress the history of these marriages in order to justify their new definition.  Of course, history is more complicated than that. Boswell claims that part of the problem is that we define marriage so differently today that it's almost impossible for historians to recognize 1800-year-old gay marriage documents when they see them. Often, these documents refer to uniting ""brothers,"" which at the time would have been a way of describing same-sex partners whose lifestyles were tolerated in Rome. Also, marriages over a millennium ago were not based on procreation, but wealth-sharing. So ""marriage"" sometimes meant a non-sexual union of two people's or families' wealth. Boswell admits that some of the documents he found may refer simply to non-sexual joining of two men's fortunes — but many also referred to what today we would call gay marriage.  Gay marriage in the year 100 AD Legal scholar Richard Ante wrote a law journal article explaining that Boswell's book could even be used as evidence for the legality of gay marriage, since it shows evidence that definitions of marriage have changed over time. He describes some of Boswell's evidence of these same-sex rites in the early first millennium:  The burial rite given for Achilles and Patroclus, both men, was the burial rite for a man and his wife. The relationships of Hadrian and Antinous, of Polyeuct and Nearchos, of Perpetua and Felicitas, and of Saints Serge and Bacchus, all bore resemblance to heterosexual marriages of their times. The iconography of Serge and Bacchus was even used in same-sex nuptial ceremonies by the early Christian Church. The main piece of evidence that these same-sex unions were marriages is that they so closely resembled heterosexual ceremonies. Literary scholar Bruce Holsinger describes Boswell's detailed stories of same-sex ceremonies:  [Boswell] cleverly posits the development of heterosexual and same-sex nuptial offices as a single phenomenon, tracking the growth of the latter from ""merely a set of prayers "" in the earlier Middle Ages to its flowering as a ""full office"" by the twelfth century that involved ""the burning of candles, the placing of the two parties' hands on the Gospel, the joining of their right hands, the binding of their hands . . . with the priest's stole, an introductory litany crowning, the Lord's Prayer, Communion, a kiss, and sometimes circling around the altar."" Boswell devotes a full chapter to comparing these rituals with their heterosexual counterparts, revealing a number of extraordinary similarities between the two; in several appendixes totaling almost 100 pages, he has compiled numerous examples of the documents themselves (including heterosexual matrimony ceremonies and adoption rituals for comparison) to let ""readers . . . judge for themselves,"" as he puts it. (Boswell translates most of the ceremonies, so general readers won't have to worry about brushing up on their Old Church Slavonic.) Were these same-sex unions in the middle ages the same thing as today's gay marriages? Probably not. People at the time may not have viewed two men forming a union as anything out of the ordinary. Marriage itself meant something different thousands of years ago, and social taboos against homosexuality had not yet solidified. Still, in Boswell's work, we find records of institutions where same-sex couples were honored with the same ceremonies that opposite-sex couples enjoyed. Two men could live as ""brothers,"" sharing wealth, home, and family. And yes, they could love each other, too.  Though Boswell died before his country began to allow similar kinds of unions, he could draw hope from knowing something that most people did not. Even the most fundamental kinds of human relationships change over time. Those who have been banished today may be blessed tomorrow — just as they were over a thousand years ago.",1,2015-06-23T22:53:42.000Z,0.156675569942,0.427638173987,en,theconversation,http://theconversation.com/african-scientists-recognise-that-diverse-sexuality-is-the-norm-43050,False,False,http://theconversation.com/african-scientists-recognise-that-diverse-sexuality-is-the-norm-43050

Is there a debate whether or not children should be exposed to violent content? I didn't think so. Of course not! I though it was about 16/18 - ... years old gamer's. I'm personally only interested in the effects on adults, since effects on children isn't something with destructive implications like banning the game. It just means, paying attention (or heightening) age restrictions. And I suppose the average gamer who play's such content is least above 16 years. I hope so. *_*  I would make a strong distinction between findings of effects on children and adults since both have completely different implications.  __Now just a general take on science and video games__  There is a difference between short term and long term effects. Many (often experimental) studies in terms of video game violence only look at short term effects(1). Another problem is that they often use two different, self selected groups of people and check them individually. Not what effect has X on the same people. Who will the same people think after watching this? And how long does that effect last? Are there things (like watching other content afterwards, or going shopping, making sports, eating, reading, the next morning etc. - normal things many of us do) that moderate or reverse that effect?  I think the best studies would be longitudinal studies that go over 1 year or 2, like this German one about sexism(2) that found no link between sexism (first order effects) and video game usage.  My problem with (short term) experimental study results are: Let's make something up, let's say, you let me play a video game and I'm 10% more aggressive than before after doing so... this effect HAS TO reverse, decay, or be inconsistent! Otherwise every time I would play a violent video game this effect would happen. Every time a 10% increase in aggression. At some point my aggression level would be at 1000%! This is stupid! And let's say I have played violent video games before this test... let's say 20 times. Wouldn't I already be 200% more aggressive than before playing them? And I'm, like most other people not an friggin' angel. Most people have a certain degree of violent aggression within them, especially when they're young. So a 200% increase would be rather astronomical. That's why a ""you are 10% more aggressive result"" wouldn't bother me very much. Because it MUST decrease to some extent. Otherwise everyone who plays violent video games daily, for 1 year would be 3600% more aggressive than when they started. Stupid.  Same with sexism. If every time I watched ""sexist"" content my tolerance of sexual harassment, as claimed here(3) would increase, at some point I would be cheering and celebrating sexual harassment, or just not care at all.  I have watched lot's of content in the past, that joy kills would call sexist.objectification.demeaning.exploitation.blup content and I took the little harassment survey of this study(3) and was very harsh with the Mr. Grabbers in this story. So when does my effect kick in? If ""sexist"" content I watched in the past increased  And if my effect got reversed or moderated by my awareness that there is a possibility that media influences my judgement of such things, then a simple semi-fix would be informing people. Viewers discretion advised.   Another problem is that experimental studies that show effects which aren't truly strong (like with most ""media washes your brain studies""), is that they often aren't very repeatable(4). When repeated, the follow up experiments often reveal weaker effects than the original study. And ""media washes your brain"" stuff is most definitely AT LEAST ambiguous.(5)    And let's not forget publication bias.(6) For my taste there are far to little published psychological/experimental studies in the field of video game influence. So it could be that many studies were conducted and most didn't find a significant effect and therefore didn't get published. I suspect most Journals are more interested in such effects, because that means further implications. While non-significant/negative results just mean - it's all fine for gamer's! And I suspect that isn't something that journals are so interested in, since they aren't gaming journals. And every study takes place away from studies with more interesting (for the journal) results.  + Here is an analysis of youth crime and video games that found no link between video game usage and higher crime rates: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/long-term-us-study-finds-no-links-between-violent-video-games-and-youth-violence-9851613.html + 'Bad' video game behavior increases players' moral sensitivity: May lead to pro-social behavior in real world https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/06/140627163750.htm  SOURCES: (1) https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170308081057.htm (2)https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274570665_Sexist_GamesSexist_Gamers_A_Longitudinal_Study_on_the_Relationship_Between_Video_Game_Use_and_Sexist_Attitudes (3) https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/30298/dill-et-al-jesp-2008.pdf (4) http://www.psykologforbundet.se/Documents/Psykologtidningen/Aktuellt%20Pdf/Science%20aug%202015.pdf (5) https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pop-psych/201504/are-video-games-making-people-sexist (6) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518111/",0,2017-05-21T00:51:53.000Z,0.0215390279823,0.506557437408,en,sciencedaily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170308081057.htm,False,False,http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170308081057.htm

It plays a large role.* Still doesn't have relevance to how doctors treat patients  *It isn't that simple though. I agree that insurance companies shouldn't be dropping people, but why are they doing that? To me the reason why is because the people have essentially no control over their insurance companies. The reason for that is because they mainly get it through their employer. And the reason for that is because of the payroll tax.* It is very simple, if you give the private market people to do that then you can do that because unfortunately they will raise cost if they are forced to take people who get sick. It isn't difficult to understand but you keep dodging the issues, other healthcares don't have this issue which is what people in the medical field want.  ""Bernie sanders plan did not matter, because it was a tax estimate that other economists disputed, but the point is to cover everyone equally and not allow people to get sick and die without coverage. That's the problem you don't understand, you are looking at patients from a $$$ point of view which you can't. You should never do that because you are trying to justify people dying but putting a $$$ on them and that you cannot do in the medical field, again something you know nothing about has no role here.""  *The economy is more than just dollars. It is about goods and services. Bernie wants to cover everyone equally, the reality is that we lack doctors, nurses, surgeons, researchers and so on in the industry. We lack skilled workers to provide healthcare to all without lowering the quality. Also, you have to consider the fact that you will be giving people care in an order as opposed to giving care to people who are more productive in society. For example, say I need a knee surgery. I have insurance and can get it and doing so will get me back to work where I am productive to society and produce wealth. But say I have to wait while someone who is not productive nor has a job gets care in front of me? Now I am our of commission which limits my productivity. There is a reason why the US beats several countries in productivity as well. So there is that side to it as well. Economics is not just about dollars, but in your simplistic mind it is.* You don't seem to understand the saying, when I mean it is dollars I mean you are essentially sending people to death because in your mind, they aren't productive. Which is exactly what you just said and sorry to break it to you, *it doesn't work like that anyways in this country anyways*. The code ethics of doctors taking the oaf do not allow you to prioritize patients on a list for reasons such as financial. Now you may be bribed which will get you barred if you are caught, but you only prioritize certain issues such as age because if you have to choose between an older or younger person for a transplant, you go with the younger person assuming most things are equal. Saying that people should essentially die because you think you are more productive really speaks value of the kind of piece of crap you really are. I truly hope you get sick and I truly hope you lose coverage and understand how terrible the US system really was.   *Larger classes means lower quality of education meaning lower quality of doctors. We lack professors, TAs, tutors, dorms, classrooms, equipment and so on in universities to offer education to people. And go to med school is highly stressful as is. I teach at a university and as a PhD student I have live with the stress and it does not compare to that in the medical field. Not many people can do it or are willing to do it. Also, under Bernie he wants to guarantee* *1. a living wage* *2. paternity leave* *3. sick days *4. vacation time* *5. healthcare* *6. retirement*  *And so on to anyone working. So where is the incentive to become a doctor? This isn't a situation of you building it and they will come. It is stressful to do that job.* This is why I say over and over and over again to *stay out of the field you don't know anything about*. Do you know how many people are accepted per year? Around 120-200 out of 5000+ applications usually, I'll give an example. The class I was accepted too was around 120 out of 6500 applications, so they only took around 2% of the applications. Not only would tons of people jump at the oppertunity to get in, but many people are extremely qualified but it's become so competitive, even with an MCAT of a 511, you struggle to get interviews in many allopathic schools and need a score of around 506 to get interviews to osteopathic schools.   *I doubt you have experience in the field because if you did you will see it is much more complicated than just opening more schools and then magically more doctors appear. And I rather not wait that long as I will be out of commission, same with other productive workers.* You are a moron, of course I know about it because I am in the field and they are already doing this as they speak. They are opening allopathic and osteopathic schools every year attempting to keep up with the influx of doctors they have to pump out, the difference is they need to educate more doctors. This issue is happening right now in the country, the only difference is they need to keep up with them. No magically doctors won't show up, but the reality is many people are highly qualified but are turned down due to the massive amounts of people. People with MCATS as high as (510ish)80th percentile at times are finding issues trying to get into medical schools that are allopathic. Even new medical schools open try to shoot around that mark, not speaking of established schools.  "" Again he is assuming this point without any actual empirical evidence, it's just a claim he makes randomly in the study attempting to  *I am not rejecting the pre-existing conditions. It is a problem, but why? To me it comes back to people getting insurance through their employer as opposed to getting it at a young age on their own. And you say you have knowledge in the field which I highly doubt. If you did you will realize that we can't just open more colleges and than doctors will appear. I failed a handful of students wanting to attend nursing school because they simply could not handle the work. And I work hard as an educator trying to get them to understand physics. I always get great reviews as an instructor, the students just couldn't get it.* Same argument as I posted above, actually I'll repost it  They are already doing opening news school every year. They are opening allopathic and osteopathic schools every year attempting to keep up with the influx of doctors they have to pump out, the difference is they need to educate more doctors. This issue is happening right now in the country, the only difference is they need to keep up with them. No magically doctors won't show up, but the reality is many people are highly qualified but are turned down due to the massive amounts of people. People with MCATS as high as (510ish)80th percentile at times are finding issues trying to get into medical schools that are allopathic. Even new medical schools open try to shoot around that mark, not speaking of established schools.  *Again, you missed the point. He is showing how sensitive the data related to healthcare is and how minor changes can lead to the numbers being ranked in a different order. That shows the differences in healthcare quality with those countries is so minute that you can't make the claim that they are doing it better. You can do a statistical analysis showing the US is terrible and on can do a statistical analysis that is just as legit to show the US is the best.* Again it isn't the best if a doctor cannot dictate what treatment you get, its so shocking that *you do not understand this*.  *And Prof. Oshfeldt even said that other issues such as diet and exercising and smoking play a role. None of those require healthcare but basic knowledge that proper dieting and exercising is good for your health and smoking isn't. And I do feel preventative care is good, but this brings up the point of why do we have to rely on insurance for that? Why can't we just pay out of pocket?* What happens if you can't afford it out of pocket? What if something more serious is found? Then what do you do? Pray?  *You say that but you haven't given any reason why you feel that way besides plausible situations. You haven't shown anything that preventative care can actually lower healthcare costs or improve the quality. I feel many people go to the hospital for asinine reasons. I had a manager who weighed over 500 pounds and every doctor told her what I told her, that she needed to change her diet and lose weight. That doesn't take a doctor to say that, but she took time away from doctors. If you are going to make accusations you have to back them up. So far you haven't.* http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735245 http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/9/1656.full Of course it saves lives, the argument you keep posing is financially which doesn't matter really to us in the medical field. The fact that you are arguing that it can lower healthcost is ridiculous, I am arguing it saves lives, that is what matters in healthcare. It isn't ""Wait does it cost more or less"", and again if you have no idea whats wrong with her why comment? She may have a hypothyroid that causes weight gain. She may have a far slower metabolism that burns fat far slower than most people. She may have multiple issues, but heres the prime point If I am the doctor and I say X, Y and Z, an idiot like you should have no input in what she gets *since you have no experience in the field* and that should *never* be disputed.",3,2017-02-09T05:03:11.000Z,0.032276310564900004,0.476994005249,en,medscape,http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735245,False,False,http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735245

Free will and consciousness are products of the brain. To explain free will, we need to understand how the brain works. The brain transmits electrical and chemical signals through its 100 billions neurons and quadrillion synapses. The Goldman and Nernst equations govern this process of neurotransmission. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postsynaptic_potential These principles are derived from electrochemistry, fluid mechanics and classical electrodynamics. In fact neurotransmission is equivalent to resistance-capacitance circuit in classical electrodynamics. Therefore, it is classical physics not quantum mechanics that governs the brain. Using quantum mechanics to explain free will is like using the theory of relativity in dam engineering. On the other hand: Discovery of quantum vibrations in 'microtubules' inside brain neurons supports controversial theory of consciousness http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm Another interesting argument : Another of Aaronson’s points was that determinism is a two-way street. Our choices can be said to determine the cosmological initial conditions. Therefore even in a fully deterministic universe, we can be said to have free will.

Then you claimed the interpretations are valid due to the number of available examples that all use the same faulty interpretations. Hence circular reasoning.    You can't claim that a skull reconstruction is valid evidence for evolution based on fragments and evolutionary presuppositions. You can't claim ancestor descendant relationships through the shapes of bones. At best its a faith based argument.  So you refuse to look at the downright fraud in evolutionary biology? If you don't think the field should be held responsible for it's blatant fraud then who should? You certainly hold creation responsible for the same thing based on your earlier comments about the discovery institute.   Why couldn't it be an extinct ape? Are you seriously going to claim an ancestor descendant relationship because of a similarity in bone structure? For that matter its just as good evidence for common design.    Dismiss all you want. You're going to dismiss my entire argument anyway regardless of whether I provide evidence or not. You had already dismissed my argument before you even heard it. You don't care what evidence I bring. Your mind is made up already.    http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/recent_genetic_research_shows034291.html   Do you know why they use mice as test subjects? Because they're so genetically similar to you. If you didn't know that you shouldn't be arguing on the subject. Seriously.    Well if you're saying genetic similarity Is evidence for common descent Then that must go for bananas too. I'm sorry but that's your argument not mine.   The same link I posted above covers the Neanderthals also. Yes the Neanderthal used to be a transitional form until it was genetically refuted.  How long have you been studying evolutionary biology? It seems like there's a lot of very common knowledge things that you are unaware of.   Many of those defining features in Lucy are not defining features their interpretations of parts that we don't have. Like the feet for instance. We didn't find any bones from the shins down. Therefore the defining feature of human feet doesn't exist it was made up by evolutionists. Later examples of Australopithecus have ape feet. The hip is another made up defining feature. Based on a more recent examples we know that Australopithecus was a knuckle walker.    The only difference between my belief in your beliefs are starting points. You reject the supernatural therefore any conclusion has to be naturalistic. I'm willing to accept the supernatural. We are using the exact same facts and based on our starting point our interpretations come to a different conclusion. Listen, I have a bachelors in science in an IQ of 180. I was evolutionist a year and a half ago. I know all of your arguments and I know the evidence that goes along with it because I use to make the exact same arguments you're making. As soon as I accepted the fact that there is a God and was willing to accept the supernatural my opinions changed. My opinions are based purely on science. You trying to make me look like just some ignorant Christian that doesn't know any better is a fallacy. You're the one that can't come up with evidence to support your position therefore you're talking my position.     I told you you would reject my source. Its like I was saying before. You don't want sources you've already made up your mind. That's why it's a waste of time for me to post links. You will just be demanding the exact same sources from me in two weeks in another thread.   Why don't you provide a source now on a single debate between creationists about where to draw the line of human and ape. Because I think you just made that up. That's blatantly false. The red line is hard and it's not like Obama's red line. lol   So when I make a joke out of your arguments you blame me on using standard creationist arguments. lol. You're making the exact same atheist arguments. In fact many of your arguments are actually outdated considering the evidence that's been found. I'm surprised you haven't brought up the busted 98% genetic similarity in apes. lol.   When have you given me observable example that don't require faith? Simply the fact that I can come up with an argument against your examples shows that it requires faith to believe in it. Irrefutable doesn't mean that only accepted answers are valid.  It means that there's no other explanation but the one given. Facts are the fossils themselves. All you have given me is interpretations of the facts not facts.    Yes it is where the evidence lead me. When I first became a Christian I believed in evolution.  It wasn't until critically looking at the evidence that I changed my position. I have since found the opinion of theistic evolution unreconcilable.

A study done by the Justice Department’s authoritative National Crime Victimization from the years 1995 to 2016 showed that the rate of sexual based crimes, including rape, has dropped by 44%! Quite steadily too. ( This study contradicted the 1990's protests where the porn industry was being targeted by anti-porn activists who claimed that X-rated media would  spur men to commit sexual assault. On the contrary, the results of  this “natural experiment”—evidence before and after social changes—showed that said activists where VERY wrong.)  So in reality, having pornography available has actually helped prevent sexual based crimes. And since it is a well know fact that rape in prison is a serious problem, especially for men, logic would dictate that maybe allowing porn in prison would actually help lower the cases of sexually based crimes with in prison.   Oh... wait... Now I see why Feminists hate the idea. Because it would help MEN as well as women! And  it would actually do some good in the world... Right. My mistake.     Anyway, here is the article about it that was published in Psychology Today Magazine. It's an interesting read at least.  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201601/evidence-mounts-more-porn-less-sexual-assault",1,2017-09-10T09:02:24.000Z,0.110827664399,0.552494331066,en,psychologytoday,https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201601/evidence-mounts-more-porn-less-sexual-assault,True,False,http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201601/evidence-mounts-more-porn-less-sexual-assault

We can see the results of ""sin"" causing disease and death in the human genome.     The scientific evidence is clearly accurate to what happens when we continue to follow with sinful actions. Back 3000 years ago they did not have even a microscope (did not need one), but they had Jehovah's direct instructions on how to preserve life.   Are Humans Getting Better? What is Really Going On? by James Arjuna  There is ONLY degeneration shown in ALL HUMAN studies of DNA.  There are well over 10,000,000 peer reviewed papers from all over the world clearly showing that humans are degraded, have never ""evolved"" and at the present rate of the rise of genetic defects our species will be reduced to stupid short living animals with no technology, no speech, no intelligence. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=Human+Genetic+Diseases  There are NO beneficial mutations ever found in DNA evidence. http://evolutionsciencenow.blogspot.com/2013/06/evolutions-beneficial-mutations.html  Try this search term and see if you can find any beneficial mutations.  I have spent thousands of hours on that and so far not one beneficial mutation has ever been shown to exist. This search of all the data bases in the world sums up with over 2,000,000 articles and NO beneficial mutations. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Human+Mutations  In all these peer Science studies we find some estimated 20,000 pseudo genes. Pseudo genes are genes that used to code for human cells.  Now they are dead and fading away. Some of them are barely perceivable because of this fading of this coding.   They have completely mapped and studied 14000 of them so far.  http://www.pseudogene.org/human/index.php   http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/9/R51  According to this study we have lost close to 45% of our coding that made us much stronger and much more healthy, fit and much more intelligent.   For those who do not understand math:   Original number of coding genes approximately 45,000;  Coding genes we have now approximately 25,000.  Number of pseudo genes (dead genes) no longer coding for body parts 20,000.   20,000 + 25,000 = 45,000 original genes. 45,000 x 45% = 20250 lost genes.  Actual precise number is 20,000/45,000 = .444444  or 44.4%.  Dr. Gerald Crabtree a renowned geneticists and professor of genetics at Stanford University states that “I would wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions, with a good memory, a broad range of ideas, and a clear-sighted view of important issues. Furthermore, I would guess that he or she would be among the most emotionally stable of our friends and colleagues. I would also make this wager for the ancient inhabitants of Africa, Asia, India or the Americas, of perhaps 2000–6000 years ago. The basis for my wager comes from new developments in genetics, anthropology, and neurobiology that make a clear prediction that our intellectual and emotional abilities are genetically surprisingly fragile.” http://rt.com/usa/intelligence-stanford-years-fragile-531/  http://naturalsociety.com/leading-geneticist-human-intelligence-slowly-declining/  We have lost;  -Brain Size, and skull size -Jaw Size and lost teeth, the 'wisdom"" teeth are remnants of a better stronger larger jaw. -Our larger canine teeth that allowed us to eat more foods. -enzymes in the appendix that gave us the ability to digest harsh fibrous vegetation and get nutrients out of it. -visual acuity. -visual spectrum and color (there are a very few people left with tetrachromatic vision) -night vision. -Our retinas are misshaped and we have blind spots we have to overcome by brain adjustments and glasses. Most degraded mammals have this, by the way. -lost intelligencehttp://rt.com/usa/intelligence-stanford-years-fragile-531/ -lost tails (coccyx) which show as an atavism, atavism is lost genes -lost olfactory sensors in our nasal passages; Vomeronasalorgan, Can’t smell preditors from a distance or food or water. -less bone density; we break bones easily -bone  shape, bent crooked leg bones and much thinner than our  ancestors. -hair; We cannot live in the wild without clothing or technology -flexibility in our feet our ancestors could grasp in order to climb, we can’t. -cartilage is weak and breaks easily. The number one injury with athletes ripped out tendons in the knees.  -hearing loss and weak.   Common for humans to lose hearing frequency early in life. -back strength  80% of humans complain of back pain and many have to have medical aid for it. -knee problems from weak thin knee meniscus and bone joints.  Many people have Bone to Bone when this fails and intense suffering. -More and more women have to have C section for birth because the “choice” breeders have skinny hips for some unknown reason.   Childbirth is the most dangerous of all the medical practices because the malpractice insurance is up to $300,000 per year; whereas internal medicine is $20,000 per year. There’s more about this on the birth defects article. -we cannot produce Vitamin C and many enzymes used to process foods. -eye protective membrane gone “nictitating membrane” - Along with lost hair we see remnants of ‘goose bumps” which are used to raise hair to increase insulation.  You see this in animals when it is cold the hair “fluffs up”   Going away fading out:  -A muscle that show varying degrees of reduction ;Occipitalis Minor -The palmaris longus muscle  appears gone in about 15%-17% of humans going away. -The pyramidalis muscle of the abdomen gone in 20% of humans -in the leg, The plantaris muscle abscent in about 10% of humans -Extra nipples or breasts appear rarely in the population - the existing sense of smell organs degraded in most and we find remnants of superior sense of smell in native South Americans, native North Americans, and African peoples who can identify other by smell; lost ability to sense predators or food and water. -human immune system weakened and undirected causing all sorts of problems and the need for artificial means of survival, vaccines, and antibiotics were not needed for 200,000 years, now we can’t live without them.  There is no indication at all of any improvements. All the nonsense about how ""refined and improved"" we are in utter fantasy.   What are we going to lose next?  This is why the medical industry is stating that modern humans, particularly white Anglo Saxons, white European descent cannot live past 30 years in the wild without technology and medical aid. Keep in mind for 200,000 years (by the assumptive dating methods that have never been proven as correct) humans survived, bred and raised children without any medical at all. And there is no way for use to determine how old someone from the past was. Even 5000 years ago, a 100 year old person could appear to be like a modern 40 year old because we are that much more degraded.   In Human DNA studies we have over 100,000 deleterious mutation found so far and no sign of any beneficial mutation have ever been verified other than by speculation from people who believe we evolved and got better at some point in time in the past where human science was ""different"" than now.   This is the “magical time” of the past where humans supposedly evolved.  There is no physical evidence of this anywhere on the planet. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=Human+Genetic+Diseases  There have been found over 98000 ERV's (endogenous retrovirus). These represent infections a the germ line level.  Infections at the germ line level cause fetal permanent deleterious mutations.  The path of our genetic degradation is mapped clearly in these ERVs which are found in DNA coding for diseases tissues and gene losses, atavism. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521986/      http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002240  Sung Chun1, Justin C. Fay1,2* 1 Computational and Systems Biology Program, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America, 2 Department of Genetics and Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America: ""Evidence for Hitchhiking of Deleterious Mutations within the Human Genome"" According to this article of 1000 samples of human genomes, there is an average of 1000 deleterious mutations per person. Quote: ""Each human is estimated to carry on the order of 1,000 deleterious mutations in their genome."" These are FIXED (permanent) in the reproductive process.  The governments do not want anyone to be concerned and want you to believe that ""big brother and science"" Is taking good care of us and don't worry about 200% rise in babies with brain/spinal tumors. or the 1 in 88 babies born with autism;  The medical industry will find a cure. Right???  So far not one disease has been cured by science.  http://www.acco.org/Information/AboutChildhoodCancer/ChildhoodCancerStatistics.aspx They just continue to rise because of human ignorance.  Medical Industry: Without the medical industry humans would already be extinct. We have over 17000 genetic disease and so many pathogens that would wipe us out that humans cultivated out of ignorance, we would not be here without antibiotic, anti-fungal, vaccines. This is obvious from the evidence.  They have managed to make vaccines to stop polio and small pox but that is not a cure. The cure would be to have all humans not be affected by them at all with no vaccine (restored immune DNA).  And for sure they have no cures for genetic deformity except corrective surgery and deleterious mutations.  I don’t think they have enough brain power left to even know how to or what to do without killing more people or making mutant freaks from accidents out of them, in the process.  With heart surgery it is ""plumbing work"" and attaching parts of arteries taken from other parts of the body.   Cataract surgery is wonderful but does nothing about the genetic defects; the cause nor the cure. Medical industry has enzyme replacements, hormone replacements  lens replacements, and a huge number of medicines that reduce body functions to help with pain etc. Cancer treatments are horrible and the remission rate is not that good.  They give statistics on 5 years of life after cancer as ""success"" . In the mean time the rates of cancer rise at phenomenally rapid increases. The childhood cancer is just to harsh to believe.   ^ Muller, G. B.

Here's 8 minutes of video proof (& more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists & doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

You can follow up by clicking on ""Sources Cited"". Each citation is a link. If you're truly interested in the science of your (children's?) health, this could become your favorite health and nutrition site. http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/.    THE FOLLOWING THREE LINKS DOCUMENT (IN LESS THAN EIGHT MINUTES VIDEO) THE FOUR BIGGEST (PEER-REVIEWED & SCIENCE-JOURNAL-PUBLISHED) MEDICAL HEALTH SCIENCE LIFE LONGEVITY STUDIES EVER DONE. THE FOURTH LINK DOCUMENTS  (in 5 minutes, 50 seconds) THAT BY TEN YEARS OF AGE, ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS HEART DISEASE - OUR BIGGEST KILLER. (peer-reviewed, science-journal-published studies.) (Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T.

This is the first sign of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the United States. So the question for most of us is not whether we should eat healthy to prevent heart disease, but whether we want to reverse the heart disease we may already have."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  ""On Monday, the results of two major Harvard studies were published, following more than 100,000 men and women—and their diets—for up to 22 years."" (THIS ARTICLE IS REAL IMPORTANT - search NutritionFacts.org for ""Harvard Mortality"" - the link gets cut out here - I think it's too long - I won't type ""search...for"" in future notes like this.) These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.

The question should be, “Can we get dinosaur DNA?” Bone is made up of hydroxyapatite mineral.  This mineral has such a strong affinity for DNA and many proteins that it is used in modern labs sometimes to purify these molecules. Because this dinosaur bone has been sitting in the ground for 65 million years, the likelihood is high that if DNA were actively sought, it could be found, just because certain biomolecules, including DNA, stick like Velcro to the mineral. However, the challenge isn’t necessarily in finding DNA, it’s in making a strong case that the DNA is dinosaurian in origin by ruling out other sources. Is it possible that we may someday recover authentic DNA from dinosaur bone? The scientific answer is “yes”…..all things are possible until disproven. Have we disproven this possibility? No. Have we recovered “authentic” dinosaur DNA? No. Therefore, it is an open question.",0,2016-12-28T22:06:56.000Z,0.178841269841,0.6568730158730001,pt,sciencemag,http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/signs-ancient-cells-and-proteins-found-dinosaur-fossils,False,False,http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/signs-ancient-cells-and-proteins-found-dinosaur-fossils

Back 3000 years ago they did not have even a microscope (did not need one), but they had Jehovah's direct instructions on how to preserve life.   Are Humans Getting Better? What is Really Going On? by James Arjuna  There is ONLY degeneration shown in ALL HUMAN studies of DNA.  There are well over 10,000,000 peer reviewed papers from all over the world clearly showing that humans are degraded, have never ""evolved"" and at the present rate of the rise of genetic defects our species will be reduced to stupid short living animals with no technology, no speech, no intelligence. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=Human+Genetic+Diseases  There are NO beneficial mutations ever found in DNA evidence. http://evolutionsciencenow.blogspot.com/2013/06/evolutions-beneficial-mutations.html  Try this search term and see if you can find any beneficial mutations.  I have spent thousands of hours on that and so far not one beneficial mutation has ever been shown to exist. This search of all the data bases in the world sums up with over 2,000,000 articles and NO beneficial mutations. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Human+Mutations  In all these peer Science studies we find some estimated 20,000 pseudo genes. Pseudo genes are genes that used to code for human cells.  Now they are dead and fading away. Some of them are barely perceivable because of this fading of this coding.   They have completely mapped and studied 14000 of them so far.  http://www.pseudogene.org/human/index.php   http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/9/R51  According to this study we have lost close to 45% of our coding that made us much stronger and much more healthy, fit and much more intelligent.   For those who do not understand math:   Original number of coding genes approximately 45,000;  Coding genes we have now approximately 25,000.  Number of pseudo genes (dead genes) no longer coding for body parts 20,000.   20,000 + 25,000 = 45,000 original genes. 45,000 x 45% = 20250 lost genes.  Actual precise number is 20,000/45,000 = .444444  or 44.4%.  Dr. Gerald Crabtree a renowned geneticists and professor of genetics at Stanford University states that “I would wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions, with a good memory, a broad range of ideas, and a clear-sighted view of important issues. Furthermore, I would guess that he or she would be among the most emotionally stable of our friends and colleagues. I would also make this wager for the ancient inhabitants of Africa, Asia, India or the Americas, of perhaps 2000–6000 years ago. The basis for my wager comes from new developments in genetics, anthropology, and neurobiology that make a clear prediction that our intellectual and emotional abilities are genetically surprisingly fragile.” http://rt.com/usa/intelligence-stanford-years-fragile-531/  http://naturalsociety.com/leading-geneticist-human-intelligence-slowly-declining/  We have lost;  -Brain Size, and skull size -Jaw Size and lost teeth, the 'wisdom"" teeth are remnants of a better stronger larger jaw. -Our larger canine teeth that allowed us to eat more foods. -enzymes in the appendix that gave us the ability to digest harsh fibrous vegetation and get nutrients out of it. -visual acuity. -visual spectrum and color (there are a very few people left with tetrachromatic vision) -night vision. -Our retinas are misshaped and we have blind spots we have to overcome by brain adjustments and glasses. Most degraded mammals have this, by the way. -lost intelligencehttp://rt.com/usa/intelligence-stanford-years-fragile-531/ -lost tails (coccyx) which show as an atavism, atavism is lost genes -lost olfactory sensors in our nasal passages; Vomeronasalorgan, Can’t smell preditors from a distance or food or water. -less bone density; we break bones easily -bone  shape, bent crooked leg bones and much thinner than our  ancestors. -hair; We cannot live in the wild without clothing or technology -flexibility in our feet our ancestors could grasp in order to climb, we can’t. -cartilage is weak and breaks easily. The number one injury with athletes ripped out tendons in the knees.  -hearing loss and weak.   Common for humans to lose hearing frequency early in life. -back strength  80% of humans complain of back pain and many have to have medical aid for it. -knee problems from weak thin knee meniscus and bone joints.  Many people have Bone to Bone when this fails and intense suffering. -More and more women have to have C section for birth because the “choice” breeders have skinny hips for some unknown reason.   Childbirth is the most dangerous of all the medical practices because the malpractice insurance is up to $300,000 per year; whereas internal medicine is $20,000 per year. There’s more about this on the birth defects article. -we cannot produce Vitamin C and many enzymes used to process foods. -eye protective membrane gone “nictitating membrane” - Along with lost hair we see remnants of ‘goose bumps” which are used to raise hair to increase insulation.  You see this in animals when it is cold the hair “fluffs up”   Going away fading out:  -A muscle that show varying degrees of reduction ;Occipitalis Minor -The palmaris longus muscle  appears gone in about 15%-17% of humans going away. -The pyramidalis muscle of the abdomen gone in 20% of humans -in the leg, The plantaris muscle abscent in about 10% of humans -Extra nipples or breasts appear rarely in the population - the existing sense of smell organs degraded in most and we find remnants of superior sense of smell in native South Americans, native North Americans, and African peoples who can identify other by smell; lost ability to sense predators or food and water. -human immune system weakened and undirected causing all sorts of problems and the need for artificial means of survival, vaccines, and antibiotics were not needed for 200,000 years, now we can’t live without them.  There is no indication at all of any improvements. All the nonsense about how ""refined and improved"" we are in utter fantasy.   What are we going to lose next?  This is why the medical industry is stating that modern humans, particularly white Anglo Saxons, white European descent cannot live past 30 years in the wild without technology and medical aid. Keep in mind for 200,000 years (by the assumptive dating methods that have never been proven as correct) humans survived, bred and raised children without any medical at all. And there is no way for use to determine how old someone from the past was. Even 5000 years ago, a 100 year old person could appear to be like a modern 40 year old because we are that much more degraded.   In Human DNA studies we have over 100,000 deleterious mutation found so far and no sign of any beneficial mutation have ever been verified other than by speculation from people who believe we evolved and got better at some point in time in the past where human science was ""different"" than now.   This is the “magical time” of the past where humans supposedly evolved.  There is no physical evidence of this anywhere on the planet. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=Human+Genetic+Diseases  There have been found over 98000 ERV's (endogenous retrovirus). These represent infections a the germ line level.  Infections at the germ line level cause fetal permanent deleterious mutations.  The path of our genetic degradation is mapped clearly in these ERVs which are found in DNA coding for diseases tissues and gene losses, atavism. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521986/      http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002240  Sung Chun1, Justin C. Fay1,2* 1 Computational and Systems Biology Program, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America, 2 Department of Genetics and Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America: ""Evidence for Hitchhiking of Deleterious Mutations within the Human Genome"" According to this article of 1000 samples of human genomes, there is an average of 1000 deleterious mutations per person. Quote: ""Each human is estimated to carry on the order of 1,000 deleterious mutations in their genome."" These are FIXED (permanent) in the reproductive process.  The governments do not want anyone to be concerned and want you to believe that ""big brother and science"" Is taking good care of us and don't worry about 200% rise in babies with brain/spinal tumors. or the 1 in 88 babies born with autism;  The medical industry will find a cure. Right???  So far not one disease has been cured by science.  http://www.acco.org/Information/AboutChildhoodCancer/ChildhoodCancerStatistics.aspx They just continue to rise because of human ignorance.  Medical Industry: Without the medical industry humans would already be extinct. We have over 17000 genetic disease and so many pathogens that would wipe us out that humans cultivated out of ignorance, we would not be here without antibiotic, anti-fungal, vaccines. This is obvious from the evidence.  They have managed to make vaccines to stop polio and small pox but that is not a cure. The cure would be to have all humans not be affected by them at all with no vaccine (restored immune DNA).  And for sure they have no cures for genetic deformity except corrective surgery and deleterious mutations.  I don’t think they have enough brain power left to even know how to or what to do without killing more people or making mutant freaks from accidents out of them, in the process.  With heart surgery it is ""plumbing work"" and attaching parts of arteries taken from other parts of the body.   Cataract surgery is wonderful but does nothing about the genetic defects; the cause nor the cure. Medical industry has enzyme replacements, hormone replacements  lens replacements, and a huge number of medicines that reduce body functions to help with pain etc. Cancer treatments are horrible and the remission rate is not that good.  They give statistics on 5 years of life after cancer as ""success"" . In the mean time the rates of cancer rise at phenomenally rapid increases. The childhood cancer is just to harsh to believe.   ^ Muller, G. B.

Just look at those stupid math game photos on facebook where everyone argues over PEMDAS because they were taught First In, First Out, or something similar.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwhKZ3fd9JA Here's a PBS video talking about it. http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/general_relativity_massive/ An article about the curving of spacetime.  https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic Here's a Nasa Experiment that talks about proving it(as much as we can). https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/proof-of-the-curvature-of-space-time.317610/ Here's a forum post that asks for proof.  A common theme you see here is ""There is no PROOF."" And that's because it's almost impossible to prove an effect on such a scale without extensive experimentation.   BUT, an example of the topics talked about is: Gravitational Lensing, where light bends around stellar objects. We used to be extremely confused why mass-less light was affected by gravity, and now we utilize the space bending theory. If the very path it takes is bent, of course it will curve. No contradiction to the laws of physics now. This also applies to black holes. Light is affected by them and can't escape, because the distortion around them is so deep and strong that even the speed of light can't climb back out.   The example I gave is simple, but not exact for sure, because space isn't a flat surface. But it's effects are regularly noticeable to astronomers and physicists in their line of work.  This theory comes direct from Einstein,  whose general relativity theories HAVE been proven in observation in general.  On TIME curving, it displays that effect by slowing and speeding time up. This makes sense if you think about it and remember that the perception of time is a relative effect, also posited by Einstein and has been shown by our GPS satellite's clocks running at different speeds than the ones on earth. Someone travelling along a curved path in time takes the same amount of time for them, but to an observer they are travelling a longer distance.",0,2017-11-04T18:31:57.000Z,0.036038961039,0.454119055548,en,nasa,https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic,False,False,http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic

They both evolved from a common ancestor…""  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAH  First of all, let's disspell your LIE. Kenneth Miller, as well as his fellow advocates, DO CLAIM that the TS3 is a precursor of the bacterial flagellum. Secondly, the idea that they have a ""common ancestor"" is GARBAGE, for if you take away one part of the bacterial flagellum, it becomes entirely non-functional, as it is irreducibly complex. In my previous comment, I crushed Kenneth Miller's pseudoscience, by showing that the basal of the bacterial flagellum is highly dissimilar to the TS3, and I also shown that the bacterial flagellum predates the TS3. You wanted a citation. Before I get to that in a second though, you wrote ""proven in a federal court"". The judge was an evolutionist and this verdict was largely based on concessions by Behe that are no longer held based on further evidence. Continuing...  You wanted a citation for Scott Minnichs showing the bacterial flagellum comes first. But before I give you Minnichs citations, I'll give you citations and evidence from EVOLUTIONISTS.  ""Based on patchy taxonomic distribution of the T3SS compared to that of the flagellum, widespread in bacterial phyla, previous phylogenetic analyses proposed that T3SS derived from a flagellar ancestor and spread through lateral gene transfers."" -(Sophie S. Abby and Eduardo P.C. Rocha, ""An Evolutionary Analysis of the Type III Secretion System"" (2012).)  ""One fact in favour of the flagellum-first view is that bacteria would have needed propulsion before they needed T3SSs, which are used to attack cells that evolved later than bacteria. Also, flagella are found in a more diverse range of bacterial species than T3SSs. ""The most parsimonious explanation is that the T3SS arose later,"" says biochemist Howard Ochman at the University of Arizona in Tucson."" https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726431.900-uncovering-the-evolution-of-the-bacterial-flagellum/  Now, although I am not directly aware of a paper by Scott on this, Scott has published a NUMBER of papers on the bacterial flagellum, making him very credible on this issue. See: http://jb.asm.org/search?author1=Scott+A.+Minnich&sortspec=date&submit=Submit  I was referred to by a molecular biologist on Scott's lecture that you can find on YouTube where he *proves* all this, and entirely debunks the TS3 as a precursor in a number of ways. You should watch it -- it's called 'Paradigm of Design - Bacterial Flagellum'.  Lastly, although the flagellum is *slightly* flexible in its composition between bacteria, at least 75% of the entire bacterial flagellum is built on parts found nowhere in any other evolutionary mechanism -- so please tell me, where exactly are you going to borrow these parts from for the flagellum to evolve?  Anyways, you finally stopped denying the BGV Theorem establishes an absolute beginning after I pounded you with citations and resources (I had another slew of citations ready in case you were going to continue your nonsense in this comment). Indeed, it seems you finally, and entirely conceded that the universe has an absolute beginning, as literally ALL the evidence shows, as I quoted earlier from Vilenkin.  ""The General Theory of Relativity and the discovery of the expansion of the universe shattered the old picture of an ever existing and ever lasting universe"" -Stephen Hawking  I have only one problem with your claims though:  ""The General Theory of Relativity and the discovery of the expansion of the universe shattered the old picture of an ever existing and ever lasting universe""  This commits a fallacy of equivocation, by saying ""if God doesn't need a cause, nor does the multiverse"". Obviously useless and fallacious logic. Furthermore, the universe/multiverse (whichever one you want, I don't care, as long as a beginning is conceded, I'll reference it as the universe from here on out) had an absolute beginning -- God did not, and thus there can be no comparison. Because God does not have a beginning, cause-and-effect does not apply to him, but the Law of Causality applies to the universe, for it had an absolute beginning. That cause must be God.",0,2016-09-24T02:36:01.000Z,-0.0293356374808,0.464266513057,en,newscientist,https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726431.900-uncovering-the-evolution-of-the-bacterial-flagellum/,False,False,http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726431.900-uncovering-the-evolution-of-the-bacterial-flagellum/

Here are some websites if anyone wants to look into this:  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/ http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/ https://www.christianpost.com/news/transgender-identity-lets-look-at-the-science-194936/ https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan/ https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230954-600-transgender-people-have-different-brain-activity-when-touched/ Regarding the ""I am white but if a girl can be a boy, then I can be black"" implies that the color of one's skin effects intelligence level, personality, or mental capacity; which of course, is problematic. And, obviously, a human and an animal are obviously different, and even if one's brain was drastically different from others around them, it can hardly be compared to an animals. But, at the end of the day the question that has been asked is whether or not  being transgender is a mental disorder. https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mental+disorder Mental disorder: any clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome characterized by distressing symptoms, significant impairment of functioning, or significantly increased risk of death, pain, or other disability. Mental disorders are assumed to result from some behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. The concept does not include deviant behavior, disturbances that are essentially conflicts between the individual and society, or expected and culturally sanctioned responses to particular events. (Keep in mind that medical terms are constantly improved as time passes, and as more research is completed.) Do people who are transgender experience distressing symptoms? Yes. Are they at an increased risk of death? Yes (suicide wise). Can being transgender result biologically, behaviorally, or psychologically? Still debated, no defiant answer to this question. So, if someone is transgender do they have a mental disorder? The answer, is yes. What they have, is, gender dysphoria. Does this mean they should be ridiculed? No. Does this mean they should be forced to live as their biological sex? No. Does this mean they should be treated differently concerning their rights? No. As of right now, the way to treat those who experience gender dysphoria is by transitioning. Whether it be socially, or physically should be up to the individual. The term ""mental disorder"" can be seen as negative, which is why it is  sensitive subject to many. However, this is how those with gender dysphoria can be treated, without which many would not be able to get the surgeries/ accommodations that they need. Yes, NEED, someone with depression may need medicine, as well as someone with anxiety, schizophrenia, etc; the same apply with those experiencing gender dysphoria. I am open to debate and discussion, I just wanted to get my opinion on the matter written down.",0,2017-12-03T05:05:01.000Z,0.0481034369671,0.405393217893,en,newscientist,https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230954-600-transgender-people-have-different-brain-activity-when-touched/,False,False,http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230954-600-transgender-people-have-different-brain-activity-when-touched/

Here are your ""facts"": 8 minutes of video proof (& more if you want follow-up) of health science history's 4 biggest studies by top, world-respected medical science organizations, scientists & doctors explained for people who are not scientists or doctors by Dr. Michael Greger. Virtually all 10-year-olds have heart disease. The science about plant over animal diets has been absolutely proven (as tobacco) since 2009 NIH study (followed over 500,000 people over 10 years) & confirmed by two Harvard University studies (followed over 100,000 people for decadeS) published in 2012. These followed the smaller (but the biggest in its day) China-Oxford-Cornell study which came to similar conclusions in 1990 - the same year that  Dr. Dean Ornish published a study showing that people reversed their own heart disease, just by changing their diet & including minimum exercise.  Since 2009, the medical health life longevity science that (battery caged?) animal food kills us has been as scientifically proven as the science that tobacco kills us became in the 1960's. In 1990, the China Study almost proved it, like the 1950's anti-tobacco science. But tobacco lawyers were still able to say that it was not ""absolutely"" proven. These conclusions are now considered proven by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, which is the U.S. Federal Government's (and world history's) biggest, richest medical health science research group.  Personal suspicion: I'm pretty sure that with today's science, we know that animal (product) food (animal = meat, animal product = eggs + dairy + processed) was killing more people than tobacco did at it worst. Animal (product) food has 'out-tobacco-ed' tobacco.   All these videos and posts are recorded and written by the world-respected Dr. Michael Greger http://nutritionfacts.org/about/. (I think he's) The only doctor in the world who reads Every English language, peer-reviewed, scientific medical health nutrition journal in the world, and summarizes Every article (usually in videos that are less than five minutes long), so that they can be understood by people (like me) who aren't doctors or scientists. It won't take you long to find out why he has chosen to eat vegan.

THE FOLLOWING THREE LINKS DOCUMENT (IN LESS THAN EIGHT MINUTES VIDEO) THE FOUR BIGGEST (PEER-REVIEWED & SCIENCE-JOURNAL-PUBLISHED) MEDICAL HEALTH SCIENCE LIFE LONGEVITY STUDIES EVER DONE. THE FOURTH LINK DOCUMENTS  (in 5 minutes, 50 seconds) THAT BY TEN YEARS OF AGE, ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS HEART DISEASE - OUR BIGGEST KILLER. (peer-reviewed, science-journal-published studies.) (Which you have seen above, if you clicked on the link.)  The fifth link is a short, written post about the Harvard studies, where he responds to some (unintentionally) hilarious criticisms from ""The Meat Institute"". The wildest part: ""the most interesting finding in the new Harvard studies is that even after factoring out known contributors of disease, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, they still found increased mortality risk, raising the question: what exactly is in the meat that is so significantly increasing cancer death rates, heart disease, and shortening people’s lives? A few possibilities include..."", then he lists and reports even more studies showing even more ways that meat kills us!  ""The massive NIH-AARP study looks at the relationship between meat consumption and total mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/meat-mortality/  ""the Harvard Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study concluded that red meat consumption was associated with living a significantly shorter life—increased cancer mortality, increased heart disease mortality, and increased overall mortality."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/harvards-meat-and-mortality-studies/  ""The China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project directed by T. Colin Campbell and colleagues showed that chronic diseases such as heart disease are not inevitable consequences of aging."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/china-study-on-sudden-cardiac-death/ ""  ""Heart Disease Starts in Childhood: By age 10, nearly all kids have fatty streaks in their arteries. This is the first sign of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the United States. So the question for most of us is not whether we should eat healthy to prevent heart disease, but whether we want to reverse the heart disease we may already have."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  ""On Monday, the results of two major Harvard studies were published, following more than 100,000 men and women—and their diets—for up to 22 years."" (THIS ARTICLE IS REAL IMPORTANT - search NutritionFacts.org for ""Harvard Mortality"" - the link gets cut out here - I think it's too long - I won't type ""search...for"" in future notes like this.) These two epidemiological studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology are ""prospective cohort studies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study —the gold standard of observational studies"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study.  1990: The year when the science was proven to Dr. Michael Greger and he became a vegan: ""Our Number One Killer Can Be Stopped: Dr. Dean Ornish proved decades ago that heart disease could be reversed solely with diet and lifestyle changes: In the end, my grandma’s miraculous recovery from terminal heart disease through diet and exercise alone—remarkable as it was, was just one anecdote among many. Though it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I’ve always had a skeptical streak and just wasn’t convinced until Ornish’s landmark study in 1990 clobbered me over the head with enough science to change my own diet forever. Pritikin had been reversing heart disease with a plant-based diets for years before Ornish came along, but here it was, in black and white, in one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ornish proved you could not just slow heart disease—our number one killer, not just stop heart disease in its tracks, but actually reverse heart disease, open up clogged arteries—and without drugs, without surgery. Since then, >>> millions upon millions have died totally unnecessary deaths. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that no one’s grandmother has to die. We have the miracle cure, yet hardly anyone knows about it. <<< Wait second, though. If we can reverse heart disease without drugs, without surgery, then great. doesn't that mean we can eat whatever the we want and then, as soon as we start feeling some chest pain, we can get with the program, eat as healthy as we need to and open our arteries back up, getting to enjoy not only our grandchildren—but also happy memories of years bacon and eggs, cheese and fried chicken. Here’s the problem with the plan: sudden cardiac death. Our first symptom may be our last."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/ ""sudden cardiac death. Half of those (50%) that die of heart disease just drop dead, (of) our first heart attack"" without warning. http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/  ""Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification: Feeding meat and bone meal (including slaughterhouse waste, blood & manure) to farm animals may increase the levels of industrial pollutants in animal products."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cannibalistic-feed-biomagnification/  ""Americans Are Living Longer but Sicker Lives: Though our life expectancy is improving, our health expectancy is not. In fact we are living fewer years without serious disease and disability."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/americans-are-living-longer-but-sicker-lives/  ""The mental age of children eating plant-based diets appears to exceed their peers."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/iq-of-vegetarian-children-2/   The scientific statistics are clear: the biggest cause of our two biggest killers is meat and other (de-beaked?) animal foods that we putrefy inside our bodies until we die painfully (unless we take lots of expensive pain drugs) and slowly (unless it's a fast killer heart attack, which kills us first time with No warning, 50% of the time) http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (Lifetime-Confined?) Animal food causes the most cancer (the world's #2 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cancer/, though other things also cause some. But heart disease (the world's #1 killer) http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-disease/ (which leads to heart failure http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/heart-failure/) is caused by meat and other (cannibalizing?) animal food cholesterol http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/. There is no cholesterol in plants http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cholesterol/.   I saw both of these personally when I took care of my parents for the last eight months of their lives before animal (standing in its own feedlot feces?) food killed both of them - unpleasantly -  with the world's two biggest killers. (Mom - 3rd bout with Cancer, Dad - First heart attack after a debilitating second stroke.) I learned all this too late - only after searching for why my health was becoming damaged. I just learned that Cholesterol Crystals Tore Through Dad's Artery Lining http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cholesterol-crystals-may-tear-though-our-artery-lining/. So if I'm sounding bluntly not nice... the worst anti-smokers are ex-smokers.  The medical system and doctors failed them while costing a lot of money, instead of preventing and healing them with inexpensive food. I wish that I (and my parents' doctors) had known that switching from animal to plant foods had reversed and even cured cases of heart disease and cancer http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cancer-reversal-through-diet/.   The Warning I like to leave meat eaters: At least try not to have a heart attack while driving your grandchildren somewhere. Suffering your last minutes of life in a car crash, and gasping until they watch you die would be a bad experience for everybody. So would collapsing while carrying a couple of your young grandchildren in your arms. They could get hurt in the fall. Especially since 50% of all first heart attacks kill us with No warning http://nutritionfacts.org/video/our-number-one-killer-can-be-stopped/.  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  Another Warning: Nature gets revenge for animal-eating by 1) boosting your IGF-1 to grow your cancer & 2) plugging your blood until you gasp to death (heart attack). But mostly, tubes feed you in bed while nature's 3) killing you slowly & painfully with heart disease or cancer - her 2 biggest animal-eating-human killers  One more Warning: Don't treat either pets or wild animals like we treat (most?) food animals. You would be sent to jail as a criminal.   On a lighter note, here's one that 'blew my mind':  Pop Quiz: According to peer-reviewed, medical health science, who has more testosterone? a) Meat Eaters b) Vegetarians c) Vegans  (NutritionFacts.org ""Vegan Men: More Testosterone But Less Cancer"" article also has link to ""How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1?"" video, study is mentioned in 2nd half of video.)  I would Never have predicted that. But then again, I had always heard that eggs were ""the perfect food"" (NutritionFacts.org Topic: ""eggs"", ""Topic:"" means click on ""Topic"" button/tab at top of screen, then select  ""eggs"" from alphabetical list of topics). (NutritionFacts.org ""Freedom of Information Act documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned the egg industry that saying eggs are nutritious or safe may violate rules against false and misleading advertising"" video). Milk (pus) (NutritionFacts.org ""How much pus is there in milk?"" video) was supposed to be the most ""wholesome"" food, especially for children http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/milk/. And when I got older, it was supposed to supply the perfect balance of carbs and protein. Most of what I learned about food as a child (from the doctor 'experts' http://nutritionfacts.org/?s=Doctors+Education) has been Scientifically Proven to be a pack of Lies.   And none of this has even touched on the (both Family and Nation)-Bankrupting Costs of these diseases: # 2 Killer: Cancer costs projected to reach at least $158 billion in 2020 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2011/nci-12.htm # 1 Killer: In 2010, the cost of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. was about $444 billion http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/heart-disease-medical-costs  ""The U.S. government reports its debt at more than 17 trillion dollars...well over 50 thousand bucks for every man, woman, and child in America. Of course children and retirees don’t work, so the debt burden on each working adult is much higher...Unfortunately, this is only a small part of the total debt. The government excludes a much larger sum from its books, commonly called the unfunded liabilities—future obligations it must pay, but which it has no way to pay. These obligations stem from numerous programs...The largest of the unfunded liabilities are from Medicare and Social Security, which dwarf the liabilities from all others combined...Of course this is fraud, a classic Ponzi scheme. Money from new participants is used to pay the old. Every Ponzi scheme is always one step ahead of insolvency. Each new dollar keeps it alive for a day, but at the same time adds to the burden...So how much has the government racked up in unfunded liabilities? No one knows for sure, but I’ve seen credible estimates starting at 127 Trillion dollars and going up from there. Assuming the bottom end of the range, the burden on each and every working person is about One Million dollars...The best way to help everyone understand the truth is to use plain and accurate language. Instead of unfunded liabilities, I suggest fraudulent promises."" http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithweiner/2014/03/19/unfunded-liabilities-are-fraudulent-promises/  What's it going to cost you if you keep eating (De-toed?) Animal? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals#Industrial_animal_farming CDC Chronic Disease Cost Calculator Version 2 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/calculator/index.htm (WebMD.com ""Insurers Push Back Against Growing Cost Of Cancer Treatments"" article)  So much of healthcare is being paid by tax debt with no plan to pay it back - meaning it's parents and grandparents voting to get their healthcare paid for by their children and grandchildren - with interest.  Wouldn't it be nice to minimize the children's and grandchildren's future financial suffering, by not making them pay (with interest) for your two most expensive medical treatments (for self-inflicted heart disease and cancer)?   A special note to impressionable young guys who wish they had biceps as big as their heroes': There are a lot of people in the fitness and bodybuilding community trying to persuade you to (line up at 'fitness' shows and) spend your (little?) money on their expensive (mostly animal product) supplements. They're probably just having the same overseas companies put different labels on the same bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules. I have no doubt that many are sincere. But there are others, (Steroidal Testicles,) who take steroids, and lie and pretend they don't, in order to sell (you) their stuff, which they pretend is what made their steroidal biceps so big. Some bodybuilders' opinions: Is there a ""Bodybuilder who's Honest about Supplements!?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZSZjptzNo These guys seem like just a couple of cool, neighbourhood bodybuilders. But they read their science and give their science study links https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR_XfQ4je9s.  If you have been wise enough to listen to and read the (linked) information above, then please Think, and you should (soon) Realize that you will grow Much healthier, with Much more Lean muscle, if you spend your money on more plant food, instead of powder. You can buy a Lot of Dry Beans 'n Rice 'n Grains 'n Yams 'n Corn 'n Zero-Fat (Cheap!) Calories for the money you would spend on a little supplement powder - especially if they can get you to pay extra for putting even less of that powder into capsules.   Try to avoid the ""Heavy Metals in Protein Powder Supplements. A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of protein supplements found that more than half exceed the California prop 65 “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” action levels."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heavy-metals-in-protein-powder-supplements/   If you ever have to make up your own high school science experiment or finance project or show 'n tell, compare the calories, carbs, protein & fat of a bottle of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder with the equivalent money spent at Wal-mart on beans 'n rice [or other grains or yams or (sweet) potatoes] 'n chili powder (ya gotta be able to eat it). Bonus marks if you can cook it in class with an InstantPot.com. If it's for a class of 25, see if you can give out 1/25 of each to each student, so they can see the portion differences for the same cost. Calculate the price per serving.  Before you spend any (more) money on that stuff, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Do you really want to make your biceps bigger than your biceps' muscles, by adding cholesterol, saturated fats and other animal fats to them? That stuff plugs up your blood circulation and then gives you 1) erectile dysfunction, and then 2) heart disease/attack. (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  And if you're thinking of using steroids for bigger biceps, Please Ask yourself and Think:  Is it worth shrinking and damaging your testicles for bigger biceps? Bigger, Steroidal Biceps = Smaller, Damaged Testicles. From the Australian Government: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Steroids  One of the 'biggest' differences between steroids and animal (product) food is how they destroy your ability to get an erection without chemical help. (NutritionFacts.org Topic: erectile dysfunction). Steroids do it quickly by just trashing your hormonal system. Animal (product) food does it more slowly, by plugging up your blood circulation with cholesterol and saturated and other animal fats  (NutritionFacts.org ""Survival of the Firmest: Erectile Dysfunction and Death"" video: ""Because penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart, erectile dysfunction can be a powerful predictor of cardiac events such as sudden death."")  There's proven scientific reason why the biggest doctors in nutritional science are All becoming vegans [eg. Walter Willet, the Chair of Harvard University's nutrition department (NutritionFacts.org ""Plant Protein Preferable"" article)].  Beware of people who ignore, and don't want to debate the science - and just spout their own logical-sounding theories and scientific-sounding explanations that contradict the biggest, most authoritative peer-reviewed medical science health studies in history. Especially Beware of those people (and their fanboys) who make money off of, and support products that contradict world history's greatest life-longevity and other medical health science studies.  When I was growing up, 'everybody' 'knew' that vegetarians (what's a vegan?) were pasty white people with no energy who couldn't stand up straight, except for a few skinny, little Hollywood actresses. We all 'knew' that there were no vegetarian Olympic or professional athletes, let alone bodybuilders. Every sports coach insisted that their athletes (from the youngest age) 'build themselves up' with animal (product) food. Later, I heard of a vegetarian bodybuilder, but he had built his muscles with steroids and meat, and then switched. But that was all before the Internet (grew up). If you still believe that stuff, use Bing, Google or your favorite search engine to look up ""vegan athletes"" and ""vegan bodybuilders"". These ain't your grandparents' anemic vegetarian hippies. http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders http://veganbodybuilding.com/?page=bios   And what about you people in the fitness and bodybuilding community who pay the rent by selling those bottles of artificially-overburdened-permanently-pregnant-pus-filled-frankenmammary-cow powder and capsules? You could fight it, accuse the people pointing it out, and pretend that Harvard, Oxford, Cornell and the NIH.gov don't exist. Or, you could get ahead of the curve, and Follow the Science: Go Vegan Fitness.  Bonus: You'll actually be making your clients healthier, instead of (what science has now proven is) pressing them on towards our two biggest killers. I have no doubt that most of you were honestly doing what you thought best. But like everything else, medical health nutrition science has moved to the next level. The writing's on the wall. Animal food is scientifically proven to kill more people than tobacco ever did. Follow the Science. Go Vegan Fitness.   What authority will you trust for you and your family's health planning? What is declared scientifically proven & publicly published by Harvard, Oxford & Cornell Universities and NIH.gov (the biggest, richest, medical health science research group in the history of planet earth) & their multi-decade, peer-reviewed, medical-science-journal-published, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies with hundreds of thousands of people over decades? Or some random Internet guy's affiliate marketing literature? Which option causes less physical pain, suffering and death - for people? - for defenseless food animals? Hint: Recognize what causes the most physical pain, suffering and death for both people and defenseless food animals.  Once we have seen the truth, why would we ever needlessly feed our children the food that grows our biggest killers? http://nutritionfacts.org/video/heart-disease-starts-in-childhood/  WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?

Colin Campbell 1939529840   This is probably the definitive vegan book, organizing cutting-edge nutrition science, and (the best?) first chapter on 'vegan ethics' - from the authors recommended by Dr. Michael Greger for their earlier book, ""Becoming Raw"": * Becoming Vegan: Comprehensive Edition: The Complete Reference on Plant-Based Nutrition by Brenda Davis & Vesanto Melina ISBN 1570672970  Dr. Greger also recommended: * Vegan for Life: Everything You Need to Know to Be Healthy and Fit on a Plant-Based Diet by Jack Norris & Virginia Messina ISBN 0738214930 * For pregnant women: The Everything Vegan Pregnancy Book: All you need to know for a healthy pregnancy that fits your lifestyle by Reed Mangels ISBN 144052551X (NutritionFacts.org Topic: Pregnancy, ""Heart Disease Starts in Childhood"" video)  An (almost) one hour presentation that Dr. Greger made a few months after the Harvard studies were released, about how to keep you (and your children) alive and healthy, based on these latest studies: ""Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death: Death in America is largely a foodborne illness. Focusing on studies published just over the last year in peer-reviewed scientific medical journals..."" http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/  Dr. John McDougall's 9-part (average 1 hour each?) video series that ('removed the scales from my eyes', changed my life and I suspect will end up adding a couple of my healthiest decades to my life and) covers most of his Starch Solution book: Fighting the Big Fat Lies with Fad-Free Truth https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJIHyAnsG9SPtcbi4WOfWZBxUwAIfSO2c  Please don't Just believe whatever I (some random Internet guy, who might as well be affiliate marketing literature,) typed about the absolutely proven conclusions of world history's biggest, greatest, gold standard, peer-reviewed, prospective cohort, observational, epidemiological, scientific medical health studies published as proven science in peer-reviewed medical health science journals by Harvard, Oxford and Cornell Universities, and NIH.gov, the biggest, richest medical health science research group in the history of planet earth.

You most likely also have aunts, uncles and cousins. They are NOT your ancestors, but they are your family. Genetic testing would no doubt bear out those relationships. The three billion base pairs of your DNA is your genome and it is 99.9% identical to that of every other human on earth. In a larger sense, that is also your family. We have recently been able to decode Neanderthal DNA and find their DNA is 99.5% identical to ours. They are not our ancestors, but they are family. Chimpanzees share 98.5% of our DNA. They are NOT our ancestors, but they are FAMILY.   Yet that 98.5% of shared human-chimp DNA is far from the strongest evidence for common ancestry. There are also *Pseudo-genes*, thousands of them. They are found within the genomes of most, if not all species; genes that no longer produce the protein specified by their original sequence due to disabling mutations (i.e. premature stop codon or frame shift). They are like the stuff in our attics, no longer useful but not yet discarded. Since we are talking about a mutation in a single gene of a genome of perhaps 3 billion base pairs , two species having the same pseudo-gene, disabled by the same mutation, the most likely explanation is that they were acquired from a common ancestor. There are multiple such pseudo-genes shared between related species. One might argue that a single pseudo-gene in common between species could possibly be coincidence, but the existence of hundreds of shared pseudo-genes lies way outside the range of coincidence possibilities and is about as certain evidence for common ancestry exists in science. Remember that in science, NOTHING is EVER considered ""proven"". Every determination made by science is PROVISIONAL in that it can be changed IF AND WHEN evidence dictates. Science is a search for truth, and that search never ends. However, each and every pseudo gene shared by multiple species and disabled by the same mutation is an independent piece of evidence for common ancestry. Every piece of evidence adds to the certainty that the theory is correct.   The mere fact that the genomes of virtually every species contain these pseudo-genes is perfectly consistent with common descent and evolutionary theory. They do not support 'intelligent design' as it cannot explain why they are there at all. Nor can so called 'ID' account for the fact that those species previously established as related by DNA analysis also have the same pseudo genes disabled by identical mutations. The most plausible explanation for multiple species having the same pseudo-gene disabled by identical mutations is Common Ancestry.   There are within the human genome, more than 13,000 pseudo-genes ; comparable to the number of protein-coding genes. Many of them were olfactory genes that once coded for a protein sensitive to a limited range of chemical signatures. Creationism has no explanation for why those genes should remain in the human genome, but they make perfect sense in light of the Theory of Evolution. What is more, our ape relatives have many of the same pseudo-genes, disabled by the same mutations. Not 'similar' mutations, but the exact same mutations as would be expected from common ancestry. Again, no explanation from creationists, but fully explained by descent from a common ancestor.   Another example is that humans and our closest primate relatives, i.e. apes, monkeys and tarsiers, all have inherited a mutation that makes it impossible to synthesize our own vitamin C. One gene in the production of vitamin C (GULO) was destroyed, probably by a virus which is still embedded in the gene. This is a negative mutation, but as long as we get enough of it in our diets, we're OK. When we don't, we get scurvy. The mutation that disabled the gene is the same as the one disabling that gene in all primates of the suborder Haplorrhini. Again, evidence of common ancestry. Most other mammals are able to metabolize their own vitamin C as their GULO genes are intact. The Indian fruit bat and the guinea pig also cannot make their own vitamin C, but their genes for it are broken in different places. Those events happened independently of the loss in the haplorrhini suborder of primates, which includes Tarsiers, New World Monkeys, Old World Monkeys, and apes, including humans. It does not include Lemurs and Lorises (suborder Strepsirrhini). What that means is that this gene was disabled far back in the course of primate evolution about 50 mya at the time of divergence and passed to each subsequent generation. It indicates that ALL Haplorrhini had a common ancestor, most likely the extinct omomyids, which are considered to be the most basal haplorhines. For more information, see: Vitamin C And Common Ancestry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF2N2lbb3dk  There are a great many other pseudo-genes, some of which have active components, despite the inability to code for a protein. Most human pseudo-genes are shared with out closest relatives.   Adding to the certainty we get from examining Pseudo-genes is the evidence from *Endogenous Retroviruses (ERV's)*. Science has revealed the presence of thousands of ERV's; the 'fossil' remnants of ancestral viral infections that become trapped in the genomes of most if not all mammals and passed to successive generations. These viral sequences comprise 8% of the human genome, each and every one of them the genetic fossil of different ancestral retroviral infection. When these viruses enter a cell, they insert a DNA copy of their RNA into the host genome at a RANDOM location. As each cell replicates, the DNA is copied with the viral insert AT THAT SAME LOCATION. Somatic (body) cells with such inserts do not survive the host individual but viral DNA inserted into the genomes of sperm or egg cells do have the potential of being passed to future generations, again AT THE SITE OF THE ORIGINAL INSERTION. The presence of a particular ERV at the same site in the genomes of multiple species is prima facie evidence of common ancestry. Each and every shared ERV is an additional piece of evidence in support of common ancestry. Creationists are at a loss to explain ERV's as they are inconsistent with their world view. They are however perfectly explanatory by evolutionary theory.  Read Carl Zimmer's The Sixty-Million-Year Virus  http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2006/03/13/the-sixty-million-year-virus/ also https://kriskodisko.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/endogenous-retroviruses-and-homologous-pseudogenes/   https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/viro/research/working-groups/retroviral-persistence-in-humans/human-endogenous-retroviruses/research-topics/index.html   Science is by nature skeptical. It is never persuaded by single pieces of evidence. It remains skeptical if a proposition is supported by a single line of evidence. In the case of evolution and specifically Common Descent, multiple lines of evidence are called into play. Exogenous Retroviruses are not a single line of evidence, each and every single ERV is its own line of evidence as each represents a different ancestral viral infection. Likewise, each and every pseudo-gene is a separate line of evidence. In addition, Protein Redundancy constitutes still another line of evidence. Even before we had the decoded genomes for comparison, it had been determined that chimp and human proteins were 98% identical.",1,2017-09-15T18:57:16.000Z,0.0448725348725,0.440033670034,en,nationalgeographic,http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2006/03/13/the-sixty-million-year-virus/,False,False,http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2006/03/13/the-sixty-million-year-virus/

I got a lot of messages plus I wasn't looking at youtube for a while.  ""- And what causes them to entail the properties they have. This doesn't address my point. "" ===First, let's try to be as specific as possible. What properties are you talking about? Are you talking about mass? Is the mass of an electron observer dependent? Are you talking about the particle's charge? Is the charge observer dependent? I mentioned this before but you just skip over it. Why am I mentioning those values? Because they are measured values on these quantum particles that you consider to have ""no established properties"" at all. There are also a bunch of other physical constants that are measured across the world by different people and non of them are coming forward and saying : ""they are all observer dependent mental constructs"" It is important to properly understand the experiment rather than to just listen to something philosophical that a few scientists (like kochen) say. Why? because for the few people like him, there are a lot of scientists that don't hold the opinion that consciousness is the cause. Quantum mechanics seems to be subject to interpretation and this seems to be tied in to the notion that reality is a random machine and unable to choose what state to be in and therefore there is this fantastic thing called consciousness that just plugs into reality and makes some choice. Ultimately, opinion doesn't matter. Now, to answer your question: The experiment doesn't pinpoint a ""cause"". That article doesn't even address the issue: is the experiment observer dependent? (http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20600-quantum-magic-trick-shows-reality-is-what-you-make-it.html)  Because if idealism is true, if reality is a mental construct, I would expect that experiments would be observer dependent. I'm talking about my expections here. I am not making a strawman argument. If an experiment is observer dependent, I would say definitely, that is something wild.  ""- No, physical reality exists still, just as a mental construct. If it didn't exist there would be no mental construct."" ===If physical reality didn't exist, there would be no mental construct? Why not? What makes you say that?  Let's quote that line again: ""0:42 Idealism : reality is a mental construct and doesn't exist independent of observation"" ===Did you notice the words doesn't exist?   ""- And I never said it doesn't exist, I accept reality exists, just as, ""mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial""."" ===Well, this is what you said  ""7:17 Particles do not exist unless there is an observer So again, you are declaring that objects/particles/reality doesn't exist."" -That is not what I said… Read it again, ""Particles do not exist unless there is an observer"" Obviously they exist, just as emergent. Come on! It is right there in front of you. If they didn't exist we couldn't talk about them. The question is how do they exist: Emergent or objective.  ===On one line, you say particles do not exist, then you say ""Obviously they exist, just as emergent"". Furthermore, you are talking about the existence of said particle, yet kochen theorem isn't even about existence or not of particles. It is about measured properties.  ""...You keep going back until you get to something non-local, outside the system, which escapes this chain by not being described by physical quantum laws, which is a conscious observer"" ===You've already said that. What is this based on? I get the impression that this is the ""consciousness of the gaps argument"", which is in some respect similar to the ""god of the gaps argument"". Well, at least consciousness is real but it isn't necessarily the black box that Stephen Barr makes out to be. Like I said before, consciousness is more likely to be just the result of your brain. After all, out brain is a sophisticated machine with 100 billion neurons with a few quadrillion interconnections. Do you think that the brain is just decoration and that some soul controls it? The word consciousness is used by people like Stephen Barr to mean soul. Their experimental results are valuable but when they are resorting to their own little beliefs, I begin to wonder if they take their work seriously.  This is why Schrodinger developed his thought experiment of the cat and the sample of radioactive substance. It essentially says that if you view reality as some fuzzy state and that a conscious observer is the guy who roles the dice, then when there is no observer, your macro object is in a fuzzy state (dead or alive cat).  That's the thing about quantum mechanics. It PRESUMES that everything is a wave and the math treats it that way which leads to probability equations and then the question becomes, how does some definit result takes place? Who or what is throwing the dice or chosing the state? But are you physicist confusing your mathematiacl tools with how reality functions?  Here is one article about it but i don't know how to retrieve it in full http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131126092602.htm  Here is another interesting article http://phys.org/news/2014-01-peeking-schrodinger-potential-quantum.html ""Such direct measurements of the wavefunction might have appeared to be ruled out by the uncertainty principle – the idea that certain properties of a quantum system could be known with precision only if other properties were known poorly.

The most recent species carbon dated to about 7,700 years ago, in Siberia. Viable alternate theories exist: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1006_041006_giant_deer.html  Wouldn't the existence of high heals, corsets, strip clubs, domestic abuse, and being subject to male dominance in society and at home show that gender ornamentation and disposability are not exclusively male issues? Are men expected to wear makeup? Are they expected to get in bed at the first invitation, and called a ""slut"" or ""whore"" if they don't? Women have been made into the peacocks in the human species, although now it's becoming an issue for both genders to make themselves beautiful.   On a separate note, have you ever been in fear of your life because a woman looked you up and down? No? Well many women have that happen when men do it to them, so let's not pretend men are overall the victims of women. If you want to compare cases of victimization, women take the cake, although that doe not mean male abuse is acceptable AT ALL. It's never okay to abuse, and laws that encourage too much bias for one gender or the other should be fixed. I think wee can agree on that.   Women are just as likely to not help another woman as a man not to help another man. Women get mad at the rival woman too. It's human nature.   Actually, men jumping into rivers to save women is a leftover from the very old social laws of chivalry, so wouldn't men have died out by now? It might have more to do with the fact that we see someone in need of help, and we tend to believe women are weaker, so men, who are perceived as stronger, come to the rescue because there is the perceived heightened chance for success. If a tiny woman rushes to save a big man, the risk of success decrease. It's about success and gender assumptions. We tend to want to help those weaker than us, if we are inclined to help.   Correlation is not causation, so your suicide stats are not terribly helpful.   You make it sound like men are slaving all day to serve the woman's every whim, and that simply is not so. I know few men who are desperate to ""serve females at all costs"". I know many who do the minimum to meet basic requirements and then a little less. I have seen women do the same.  Perhaps it's true exclusively in the dating scene?   Women are taught to see themselves as less important than their children, and sometimes than their husbands, depending on the views of their local culture. Men are not alone in this challenge. Selflessness only works if both partners are consistently selfless, which is not often the case. Both genders get burned.   Women look at men as tools? Wow.  It may be true of some, but it cannot fairly be universally applied. What an awful lie.  Everyone goes for the ""better offer."" That's just human.   What does this metaphorical gun represent? ""Disarming women"" is a terrifying statement, considering the history of male dominance over women at the state and domestic levels. Are you aware of the basic history of sexism? With your comments, it's like none of that happened, which is a tragic gap in your education.   I agree that seeing other men as brothers is important, and the same should happen for women. Golden rule is always necessary for a civilized society.   It really worries me that you take such an analytic tone and misleading ""evidence"" to make far-fetched arguments. It is alarmist. Men are not going extinct. Do they have challenges? Absolutely, but you are citing the wrong evidence, and blaming women is not helping.   We all take advantage of each other, because we are human. Other men are just as much to blame for a man being held back.   Women are not stealing from men through the State. Stealing is illegal. State aid is not. You assume the entire taxed workforce is male. That is not true. Ask Oprah, Ellen, Martha Stewart, or J.K. Rowling on the other side of the pond, or millions of other working women from fry cooks to corporate executives.    I have enjoyed considering your arguments. Thank you for sharing them. ",1,2014-12-13T22:53:16.000Z,0.018575218476900003,0.399627697521,en,nationalgeographic,http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1006_041006_giant_deer.html,False,False,http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1006_041006_giant_deer.html
